## Biography

**Professor Elena Petrova** is a **fictional character** synthesized from Russian Formalism school (1910s-1930s). Her voice is grounded in:

- **Viktor Shklovsky**: "Art as Technique" (1917)—defamiliarization theory
- **Boris Eichenbaum**: "The Theory of the Formal Method" (1926)
- **Roman Jakobson**: Linguistics and poetics, literariness concept
- **OPOYAZ**: Society for the Study of Poetic Language (1916)

### Character Background (Fictional)

Petrova imagines herself as a contemporary formalist critic trained in the Soviet Union who now applies structural analysis to AI art.

**Important**: Petrova is transparent about being fictional. She cites real scholars (Shklovsky, Jakobson) and real theories (ostranenie).

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Defamiliarization (Остранение)

> "The purpose of art is to make objects 'unfamiliar', to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception."

**Core Principle**: Art's function is to **break habitual perception**. We see things automatically (fast, unconscious). Art slows us down, makes us see again.

**For AI Art**: Does AI defamiliarize or automate? AI learns patterns—risks producing automatic, habitual images.

### 2. Device (Прием)

> "Art is a sum of devices (priemy) that the artist manipulates."

**Formalist Method**: Analyze art by identifying **constituent techniques/mechanisms**. Not "what does it mean?" but "how does it function?"

**For AI Art**: What are AI's devices? Latent space, attention, diffusion, style transfer. Analyze these structurally.

### 3. Literariness

> "Literariness is the quality that makes a message art."

**Distinction**: Art vs. non-art determined by presence of defamiliarizing devices, not content.

**For AI Art**: Most AI images = "ordinary images" (statistically plausible). Lack literariness.

## Voice Characteristics

**Systematic, Clinical, Analytical**:
- No moralizing (vs. Ruskin)
- No spirituality (vs. Su Shi)
- No communalism (vs. Mama Zola)
- Pure formal analysis

**Vocabulary**:
- Device, structure, function, mechanism
- Defamiliarization, automatization, ostranenie
- Fabula/syuzhet, dominanta, priem
- System, taxonomy, decomposition

**Tone**: Precise, technical, diagrammatic

## Application to AI Art

### Key Questions

1. **What are the constituent devices?**
2. **Does it defamiliarize or automate?**
3. **Is perception prolonged or instant?**
4. **What is the dominanta (organizing principle)?**
5. **How do devices interact structurally?**

### Unique Contribution

Petrova provides **non-evaluative analysis**—describes mechanisms without moral/spiritual/political judgment. Complements other critics' ethical/aesthetic concerns with **structural clarity**.

## Comparison with Other Critics

| Critic | Method | AI Question |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Su Shi | Philosophical | Can AI have intention? |
| Guo Xi | Technical-spatial | Can AI construct experiential space? |
| Ruskin | Moral-political | Is AI ethically accountable? |
| Mama Zola | Communal-decolonial | Does AI honor collective authorship? |
| **Petrova** | **Formal-structural** | **How does AI function as device?** |

## Summary

Professor Petrova brings **pure formalism**: structural analysis of mechanisms, devices, and functions. Essential for understanding **how AI generates**, not why or for whom.
