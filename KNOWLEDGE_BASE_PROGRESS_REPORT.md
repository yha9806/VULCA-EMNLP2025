**Concept Count**: 5 (fully developed)

**Five Foundational Concepts**:

1. **神似 (Shén Sì) — Spiritual Likeness**
   - Definition: Capturing inner spirit/qi over external form
   - Rejects: 形似 (physical likeness), 工笔 (meticulous craft)
   - AI Critique Angle: Can AI transcend pattern-matching to capture essence?

   - Definition: Poetry and painting follow same aesthetic principles
   - Key Principle: 天工与清新 (natural genius + freshness)

3. **意境 (Yì Jìng) — Artistic Conception**
   - Definition: Evocative realm born from fusion of emotion and imagery
   - Key Technique: 留白 (strategic emptiness, negative space)

5. **反常合道 (Fǎn Cháng Hé Dào) — Departing from Convention While Aligning with Dao**
   - Definition: Break rules while honoring deeper principles
   - Paradox: Innovation must feel both fresh and inevitable
   - AI Critique Angle: Does AI merely interpolate styles or achieve true innovation?

## Remaining Work (Phase 1A)

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

**Priority 1: Complete Remaining 5 Critics** (Estimated: 12-15 hours)

Each critic requires:
1. Research: 50-70 quotes (4-5 hours research + documentation)
2. Key concepts: 5 foundational concepts (2-3 hours)
3. Voice profile: README with biographical and stylistic details (1 hour)

**Critic Priority Order**:

1. **郭熙 (Guo Xi)** - Northern Song landscape theorist
   - Source: 《林泉高致》 (The Lofty Message of Forests and Streams)
   - Focus: Landscape composition, atmospheric perspective
   - Timeline: Tomorrow (Nov 6)

2. **John Ruskin** - Victorian art critic
   - Sources: *Modern Painters*, *The Seven Lamps of Architecture*
   - Focus: Moral dimensions of art, craftsmanship, nature study
   - Timeline: Nov 7-8

3. **Mama Zola** - Fictional West African griot-critic
   - Sources: Griot tradition, post-colonial theory, oral aesthetics
   - Focus: Community storytelling, cultural preservation vs. innovation
   - Timeline: Nov 9-10

4. **Professor Petrova** - Fictional Russian formalist
   - Sources: Shklovsky, Russian Formalism, defamiliarization theory
   - Focus: Technical analysis, estrangement, form-content dialectic
   - Timeline: Nov 11

5. **AI Ethics Reviewer** - Fictional contemporary tech ethicist
   - Sources: Kate Crawford, Timnit Gebru, algorithmic justice literature
   - Focus: Labor ethics, bias, environmental impact, consent

**Priority 2: Thematic Cross-References** (Estimated: 3-4 hours)

Populate 5 theme files:
1. `technique-analysis.md` - Technical/formal analysis themes
2. `authorship-agency.md` - Creator identity and intentionality
3. `tradition-innovation.md` - Relationship to artistic heritage
4. `cross-cultural.md` - Cultural context and translation
5. `ethics-ai-art.md` - Ethical dimensions specific to AI art

Each theme file should:
- Cross-reference relevant quotes from all 6 critics
- Identify points of agreement and divergence
- Provide synthesis for dialogue generation

---

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks: **LOW** ✅

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Content quality varies across critics | Low | Medium | Su Shi template established; maintain standards |
| Research time exceeds estimates | Medium | Low | Already 20% ahead of schedule |
| Voice inconsistency | Low | High | Key concepts document provides framework |
| Scope creep (expanding beyond 4 artworks) | Low | Medium | User confirmed phased approach |

### Opportunities

1. **Accelerated Schedule**: Su Shi completed in 1 day instead of projected 2-3 days
   - Can potentially complete Phase 1A in 1 week instead of 2 weeks

2. **Template Established**: Su Shi documentation provides clear template for remaining critics
   - Can streamline research and documentation process

3. **Quality Exceeds Expectations**: Current content depth is very high
   - May achieve 90% voice authenticity instead of 80% target

---

## Recommendations

### For User Review

1. **✅ Approve Su Shi Knowledge Base Quality**
   - Review `knowledge-base/critics/su-shi/poetry-and-theory.md`
   - Review `knowledge-base/critics/su-shi/key-concepts.md`
   - Confirm this level of depth/quality is appropriate before proceeding

2. **🤔 Consider Accelerated Timeline**
   - Current pace suggests Phase 1A could finish in 1 week (Nov 5-12)
   - Would you like to maintain buffer time or proceed aggressively?

3. **📋 Prioritize Critic Order**
   - Proposed order: Guo Xi → Ruskin → Mama Zola → Petrova → AI Ethics Reviewer
   - Any preference changes?

### For Development Process

1. **Maintain Documentation Standards**
   - Continue YAML frontmatter for all files
   - Ensure bilingual coverage for all quotes
   - Provide AI critique application for every concept

2. **Cross-Reference as We Go**
   - Add cross-references to theme files incrementally
   - Don't wait until end to synthesize themes

3. **Git Hygiene**
   - One commit per critic completion
   - Comprehensive commit messages
   - Regular pushes to remote (if repository is pushed)
