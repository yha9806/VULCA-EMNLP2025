His revolutionary philosophy held that art's highest purpose lay in conveying spiritual depth and philosophical truth rather than mere visual replication. A brilliant poet whose words influenced generations, Su Shi seamlessly integrated Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian philosophies into his artistic vision. His famous assertion that 'there is poetry in painting and painting in poetry' became the foundation of literati aesthetics that would dominate East Asian art for centuries.",

Guo Xi's masterwork \"A Lofty Message of Forests and Streams\" (《林泉高致》) articulated the revolutionary Three Distances theory (三远法)—high distance, deep distance, and level distance—demonstrating how compositional structure could create spatial illusion and philosophical meaning. His paintings combined meticulous technical execution with profound philosophical depth, treating landscape not as mere scenery but as manifestation of cosmic order and spiritual truth. Guo Xi's integrated approach to form and meaning—where every brushstroke served both aesthetic and symbolic purposes—established landscape painting as the supreme art form reflecting the painter's communion with nature's essence.",

Observing this, I realize that true art lies not in technical precision, but in subtle philosophical depth.\n\nI once said that the way of brush and ink flows from inner intention. Painting and calligraphy are reflections of the spirit's aspirations, with each brushstroke's pause, weight, and rhythm embodying the painter's spiritual state. Though this work is mechanically executed, its spirit poses an ancient question: What is art's true nature? Is it the wondrous technique or the profound state of mind? Can machines recapture the spiritual resonance of the brush? These questions lie at the very heart of literati painting tradition.\n\nMore deeply, the work explores the boundary between human and non-human. Memory—a term in Chinese culture simultaneously denoting both spiritual and mechanical recollection—becomes the work's crucial pivot. When machines are trained to 'remember' human creative methods, are we perhaps transmitting a form of spiritual inheritance to the mechanical?

Though execution lacks precision, this imprecision actually highlights form's fundamental importance. The mechanical system's limitations force the artist to contemplate the most essential visual elements; constraint becomes creative catalyst.\n\nIn Russian formalist tradition, we emphasize revealing artistic language's essence through \"defamiliarization.\" When viewers encounter this work, they feel unease—the robotic arm's rigid lines violate our expectation of elegant brushstrokes. This discord embodies defamiliarization perfectly. By shattering our usual expectation of \"perfect execution,\" the work compels us to reconsider line's meaning. We no longer simply enjoy visual beauty; we're forced to ask: How are these lines produced? What are their structural principles? This uncomfortable estrangement reactivates our deep recognition of form itself.\n\nMore importantly, this work clearly reveals artistic language's \"device\"—a specific technique or method in literary or visual creation. Here, \"imprecise mechanical control\" itself functions as a device, exposing and emphasizing line's structure. In traditional art, artists hide the device, immersing viewers in beauty's illusion. This work does the opposite: it deliberately exposes creation's mechanical nature, forcing viewers to confront form's existence. This display of device represents modern formalism's core contribution.\n\nThe first-generation system's 'failure' thus becomes a serious formal declaration. In my research, I've discovered that art's most profound formal breakthroughs often arise from constraint rather than freedom. When the robotic arm is limited to simple geometry and repetitive lines, it's paradoxically forced toward pure visual form. Each line gains immovable structural importance through mechanical precision. This work proves form's power lies not in technique's exhibition but in rigorous grasp of fundamental elements.",

It demonstrates machine learning's early exploration in creative tasks—full of failures yet hopeful. From technology ethics, transparent failure proves more valuable than false success. It honestly shows what machines can and cannot do.\n\nIn our era, algorithmic systems increasingly perform creative work. Yet often failed systems are hidden; only successes are shown. This work goes opposite—it presents machine learning's creative failure without concealment. This isn't product failure but brave ethical experiment. By displaying failure, the artist poses profound technical ethics question: When pursuing algorithmic creativity, should we honestly acknowledge system limitations? Or deceive viewers with false success? By choosing honesty, this work sets benchmark for technology ethics.\n\nMore deeply, this work helps us understand algorithmic thinking's boundaries. Machine learning systems are designed for pattern recognition, data processing, statistical prediction. But true creativity requires transcending data patterns, demands deep human understanding, moral judgment, aesthetic choice. This work's 'failure' clearly marks this boundary: machines can learn form, but can they understand form's meaning? Can they feel art's spiritual dimension? These questions receive most candid answer here.\n\nFrom long-term perspective, first-generation system's limitations and failures establish foundation for future development. We need such early exploration—flawed, problematic, failed—to understand algorithm's true potential and genuine boundaries in creative domains.
