      "textEn": "Observing Li Jun's 'Unstable Contours,' the title显 philosophical thinking—what is 'contour'? Boundary, border, definition. Yet 'unstable' three characters dissolve certainty. This accords with Buddhism's 'all dharmas are without self' principle, Daoism's 'the way that can be spoken is not the eternal way' meaning. All things flow, boundaries are虚设. I once said 'viewed horizontally as ridge, sideways as peak'; things' forms differ by perspective, where comes fixed contour? If this work can让观者 experience this 'boundary dissolution,' 'form transformation,' it can provoke deep thought about 'essence,' 'identity,' 'existence.' Yet if instability is excessive, it leads to nihilism; if transformation is unlimited, grasp is lost. I suggest finding tension between 'stable' and 'unstable'—让形态 both flowing and recognizable, both changing and patterned. Like water's flow, though formless, has its momentum; like clouds' transformation, though unpredictable, has its principles.",

      "textZh": "审《不稳定轮廓》，其视觉策略当借鉴「没骨法」——不勾轮廓线，直接以色或墨晕染形态。此法之妙，在于「界限的模糊」——色与色之间、形与形之间，没有明确分界，而是渐变、渗透、融合。李君若精通此法，可创造出真正「不稳定」却又「有韵」的视觉效果。又可参考「泼墨法」——大片墨色泼洒，任其自然流淌、自然渗透，形成不可预测的形态。这种「偶然性」「不可控性」，正是「不稳定」的最佳体现。然吾提醒：偶然不等于随意，不可控不等于无章法。即使是泼墨，也需掌握纸的湿度、墨的浓度、力度的大小，方能「偶然中见必然」。",
      "textEn": "Examining 'Unstable Contours,' its visual strategy should reference 'boneless method'—not outlining contour lines, directly rendering forms with color or ink. This method's wonder lies in 'boundary blurring'—between colors, between forms, no clear demarcation but gradation, permeation, fusion. If Li Jun精通 this method, can create truly 'unstable' yet 'resonant' visual effects. Also reference 'splashed ink method'—large patches of ink splashed, letting it naturally flow, naturally permeate, forming unpredictable forms. This 'contingency,' 'uncontrollability' is precisely 'instability's' best embodiment. Yet I remind: contingency doesn't equal randomness, uncontrollability doesn't equal lawlessness. Even splashed ink requires mastering paper's moisture, ink's concentration, force's magnitude, to 'see necessity within contingency.'",

      "textEn": "'Unstable Contours' makes me contemplate 'truth' and 'uncertainty's' relationship. Throughout my life I pursued truth—artistic truth, moral truth, social truth. In my view, truth is stable, knowable, should be upheld. However, Li Jun's work seems to question this certainty—if all is unstable, where is truth? I must admit, my era (Victorian period) was indeed overconfident, believing science, reason, progress could solve all problems. Today's uncertainty perhaps is necessary correction to that excessive certainty. But I still insist: cannot abandon pursuing truth because uncertainty exists; cannot deny boundaries exist because boundaries blur. In art, we can explore instability, but in morality, we must uphold basic principles—honesty, justice, compassion. These values should not be 'unstable contours' but 'stable foundations.'",

      "textZh": "《不稳定轮廓》让我想起我们对「身份」的理解。在西方思维中，身份是固定的——你是谁就是谁，有清晰的界限。但在我们的传统里，身份是流动的、关系性的——你在家庭中是一个角色，在社区中是另一个角色，在不同情境中展现不同面向。这种「不稳定的轮廓」不是问题，而是自然状态。李君若能展现这种「多重身份」「流动身份」的可能性，将很有文化价值。然而，我也担心：在全球化、数字化的今天，这种流动性是否被过度强调？许多被边缘化的群体（移民、难民、少数族裔），他们的「不稳定轮廓」不是自由选择，而是被迫状态——他们渴望稳定的身份、明确的归属、被承认的存在。因此，谈论「不稳定」时，需要区分：这是特权者的实验还是弱者的困境？",
      "textEn": "'Unstable Contours' reminds me of our understanding of 'identity.' In Western thinking, identity is fixed—who you are is who you are, with clear boundaries. But in our tradition, identity is fluid, relational—you are one role in family, another role in community, displaying different facets in different contexts. This 'unstable contour' is not problem but natural state. If Li Jun could display this 'multiple identity,' 'fluid identity' possibility, it would have considerable cultural value. However, I also worry: in today's globalized, digitized world, is this fluidity overemphasized? Many marginalized groups (migrants, refugees, minorities), their 'unstable contours' are not free choice but forced状态—they渴望 stable identity, clear belonging, recognized existence. Therefore, discussing 'instability' requires distinguishing: is this privileged people's experiment or vulnerable people's predicament?",

      "textEn": "'Unstable Contours' from formalist perspective embodies 'form's autonomy. ' Shklovsky emphasized: art's value lies not in representing reality but in form itself's innovation. 'Unstable contours' as formal strategy breaks the convention that 'forms must have clear boundaries'; this itself is defamiliarization. Bakhtin's 'unfinalizability' theory is also relevant here—people are not fixed essence but open possibility; works are not closed meaning but continuous dialogue. If Li Jun could transform this theory into visual form—让轮廓 always in 'becoming' not 'completed' state—it would be very powerful. However, Russian Formalism also reminds: formal innovation must have 'motivation. ' What does this work's 'instability' express. Merely formal experiment or deeper cultural, philosophical, political implications. Without motivation, formal innovation appears hollow.",

      "textZh": "《不稳定轮廓》在AI时代有特殊意义——AI的核心能力恰恰是「定义边界」。图像识别AI通过「边缘检测」算法找出物体轮廓；分类AI将事物归入固定类别。这种「边界化」「类别化」的认知模式，简化了复杂世界，但也丢失了细微差异。「不稳定轮廓」是对这种AI认知的反叛——它提醒我们：真实世界的界限远比算法假设的更模糊、更流动、更复杂。更深层的问题是：当AI越来越多地参与社会分类（如人脸识别、信用评分、风险评估），「不稳定轮廓」成为危险——你的身份、信用、风险等级被算法固定，难以改变。这种「轮廓的固化」剥夺了人的流动性、成长性、多样性。李君若能批判性地探讨这一点，将有重要社会意义。艺术应该捍卫「不被定义的权利」「保持模糊的自由」——在这个越来越追求精确量化的时代，模糊性、不确定性、不稳定性，反而成为抵抗的方式。",
      "textEn": "'Unstable Contours' has special significance in AI era—AI's core capability is precisely 'defining boundaries. ' Image recognition AI finds object contours through 'edge detection' algorithms; classification AI归 things into fixed categories. This 'boundary-making,' 'categorization' cognitive模式 simplifies complex world but also loses subtle differences. 'Unstable contours' is rebellion against this AI cognition—it reminds us: real world's boundaries are far more blurred, fluid, complex than algorithms assume. The deeper question is: when AI increasingly participates in social classification (like facial recognition, credit scoring, risk assessment), 'unstable contours' become dangerous—your identity, credit, risk level is固定 by algorithms, hard to change. This 'contour solidification' deprives people's fluidity, growth capacity, diversity. If Li Jun could critically explore this point, it would have important social significance. Art should defend 'right not to be defined,' 'freedom to remain ambiguous'—in this increasingly precise quantification-pursuing era, ambiguity, uncertainty, instability inversely become resistance methods.",
