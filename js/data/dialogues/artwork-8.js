      "textZh": "观《烂柯人》，不禁忆起王质烂柯之典故——樵夫入山观仙人对弈，不觉斧柄已朽，返乡已是百年。此作名「烂柯人」，不绘仙人，不绘棋局，却绘「朽败」本身，可谓深得「留白」之妙。三位艺术家合作，正如三人对弈，各持一子，共成一局。「烂柯」之典，本是时间之寓言——人世匆匆，仙界悠悠，人生在宇宙中不过弹指一挥。今三位艺术家以「腐朽」「衰败」为题材，实是对这一古典主题的当代诠释。然吾观此作，更见其对「变化」之思考——腐朽不是终结，而是转化。佛家言「色即是空，空即是色」，道家言「反者道之动」，万物皆在变化中，所谓「烂柯」，正是旧的形态消解，新的形态萌生之时。此作若能更明显地展现这种「生死转化」「新旧交替」之过程，则境界更高。",
      "textEn": "Observing 'The Rotten Man,' I cannot help but recall the allusion of Wang Zhi's rotten axe handle—a woodcutter entered mountains to watch immortals playing chess, unknowingly his axe handle rotted; returning home, a hundred years had passed. This work named 'The Rotten Man' depicts neither immortals nor chess game but 'decay' itself, which can be said to profoundly grasp 'leaving blank's' wonder. Three artists collaborate, like three playing chess, each holding one piece, together completing one game. The 'rotten axe' allusion is fundamentally time's allegory—human world hurried, immortal realm leisurely; human life in the universe merely a snap of fingers. Today three artists taking 'decay' and 'decline' as subject matter is actually contemporary interpretation of this classical theme. Yet observing this work, I see more its contemplation of 'transformation'—decay is not ending but transformation. Buddhists say 'form is emptiness, emptiness is form,' Daoists say 'reversal is Dao's movement'; all things are in transformation; the so-called 'rotten axe' is precisely when old forms dissolve, new forms emerge. If this work could more obviously display this 'life-death transformation,' 'old-new alternation' process, the realm would be higher.",

      "textZh": "审《烂柯人》之构图，三人合作，当有「主次呼应」「虚实相生」之法。然现代艺术多标榜「打破传统」，不知是否仍遵循这些原则。「烂柯」之题材，本是山水画常见母题——深山、古树、棋局、时间，皆是山水画之经典元素。若以山水画法论之，「腐朽」可对应「枯木」「寒林」之传统——宋元画家善绘枯树，以其「枯而不死」「瘦而有力」表现生命的韧性。此作若能借鉴这一传统，在视觉上不仅表现「烂」（腐败、衰败），更表现「韧」（残存、坚持），则层次更丰富。又，「烂柯」典故中的「时间」，在山水画中常以「季节变化」「昼夜交替」表现。此作若能设计某种「时间可视化」——例如同一对象在不同腐朽阶段的对比，或通过色彩明暗表现时间流逝——则更能体现「烂柯」之精髓。",
      "textEn": "Examining 'The Rotten Man's' composition, three people collaborate; there should be methods of 'primary-secondary correspondence' and 'void-solid mutual generation. ' Yet modern art often proclaims 'breaking tradition'; I wonder if it still follows these principles. The 'rotten axe' subject matter is fundamentally landscape painting's common motif—deep mountains, ancient trees, chess games, time are all landscape painting's classical elements. Discussing through landscape painting methods, 'decay' can correspond to 'withered wood' and 'cold forest' traditions—Song-Yuan painters excelled at depicting withered trees, using their 'withered yet not dead,' 'lean yet powerful' to express life's resilience. If this work could reference this tradition, visually expressing not only 'rotten' (decay, decline) but also 'tenacious' (remnant, persistence), the layers would be richer. Also, 'time' in the 'rotten axe' allusion, in landscape painting is often expressed through 'seasonal changes' and 'day-night alternation. ' If this work could design some 'time visualization'—for instance contrasting the same object at different decay stages, or expressing time's passage through color brightness and darkness—it would better embody 'rotten axe's' essence.",

      "textEn": "'The Rotten Man' reminds me of my analysis of Turner's works in 'Modern Painters. ' Turner's late works often depicted 'disintegration' and 'dissolution' scenes—ships in storms, cities in mist, ruins in sunset. These images appear to be 'destruction' on the surface, but are actually reverence for natural forces, contemplation of time's eternity. This work taking 'decay' as theme, if it could reach Turner's realm of 'seeing eternity within destruction,' would be extraordinarily valuable. However, I must ask: is this decay intentionally created by the artists or the result of genuine observation. If the former, then it's merely 'aestheticized decay,' losing authenticity. If the latter, have the artists truly deeply observed decay's process. Do they understand its natural laws. Throughout my life I emphasized: true art must be built upon faithful observation of nature. Painters cannot merely pursue 'effects' but must understand 'causes'—why does wood rot. How do microorganisms act.",

      "textZh": "《烂柯人》让我想起我们对「祖先」的态度。在我们的文化中，死亡不是结束，而是转化——身体会腐朽，但精神会延续，会融入土地、融入社区、融入后代的记忆。因此，「腐朽」不是可怕的，而是神圣的——它是生命循环的一部分，是归还大地的过程。然而，我也看到了不同文化对「腐朽」的不同态度。在西方现代文化中，人们恐惧衰老、恐惧死亡、恐惧腐朽，试图用各种技术（防腐剂、整容、冷冻）来延缓或阻止它。这种态度反映了对「线性时间」的信仰——认为时间是单向的，腐朽是失败。而在我们的文化中，时间是循环的，腐朽是回归。此作若能展现这两种文化态度的对比，将非常有启发性。三位艺术家的合作，也让我想起我们的社区艺术传统。在我们的村子里，艺术不是个人的创作，而是集体的仪式——唱歌、跳舞、讲故事，都是大家一起完成的。",
      "textEn": "'The Rotten Man' reminds me of our attitude toward 'ancestors. ' In our culture, death is not ending but transformation—the body will decay, but the spirit will continue, will merge into land, into community, into descendants' memory. Therefore, 'decay' is not frightening but sacred—it's part of life's cycle, the process of returning to earth. However, I also see different cultures' different attitudes toward 'decay. ' In Western modern culture, people fear aging, death, decay, trying to use various technologies (preservatives, cosmetic surgery, freezing) to delay or prevent it. This attitude reflects belief in 'linear time'—considering time unidirectional, decay as failure. Whereas in our culture, time is cyclical, decay is return. If this work could display the contrast between these two cultural attitudes, it would be very enlightening. The three artists' collaboration also reminds me of our community art tradition. In our village, art is not individual creation but collective ritual—singing, dancing, storytelling are all completed together.",

      "textEn": "'The Rotten Man' as multimedia collaborative project, its structure merits analysis from a formalist perspective. Bakhtin's proposed 'polyphony' theory is very enlightening here—true polyphony is not simple superposition of several voices but equal dialogue of several 'consciousness centers'; each voice has its independence yet produces new meaning in dialogue. If the three artists' collaboration could achieve this 'dialogism,' it would be very valuable. However, from current information, I cannot judge whether this collaboration achieved true polyphony or merely 'collage. ' Shklovsky emphasized 'laying bare the device'—excellent art should make viewers aware of its construction method rather than immersed in illusion. If this work could let viewers clearly see 'how three people collaborate,' 'what each contributed,' 'how to coordinate different styles,' it would have more 'literariness.",

      "textEn": "'The Rotten Man' provokes reflection on 'digital immortality' versus 'material decay. ' In the AI era, we face a paradox: everything in the material world will decay (body, architecture, relics), but everything in the digital world can theoretically persist forever (data, code, virtual avatars). This brings profound ethical questions: 1) Does digital immortality change 'death's' meaning. When a person's digital doppelgänger (AI chatbot, virtual avatar) can exist permanently, how do we define 'death'. 2) Is material world's decay devalued. When we can digitally preserve everything, does real, decaying matter lose value. 3) Who has the right to decide what should be permanently preserved. Digital preservation requires energy, servers, maintenance; these resources' allocation involves power and inequality. If this work could explore these questions, it would be very timely. The 'rotten axe man' metaphor is also interesting—in the digital age, we are all 'rotten axe people'; when we immerse in the digital world (games, social media, virtual reality), real world's time flows, real body ages, real relationships dissolve.",
