      "textEn": "Observing Liu Jun's \"Walking with Difficulty,\" its title strikes at the heart of contemporary human predicament—where each path proves arduous, every step meets obstruction. Throughout my life of wandering exile, from the capital to Huangzhou, from Huangzhou to Huizhou, from Huizhou to Danzhou, each step has been fraught with difficulty. Yet I have come to understand: \"walking with difficulty\" encompasses both external obstacles and internal attachments. External obstacles—societal oppression, interference from others, environmental constraints—these constitute \"objective difficulties. \" Internal attachments—personal expectations, desire's compulsions, the bondage of goals—these form \"subjective difficulties. \" Their interweaving creates the \"path of hardship. \"\n\nThis work depicts \"struggle, persistence, and constrained movement,\" emphasizing \"making hidden obstacles visible, revealing embodied knowledge\"—this is profoundly significant. Often, true obstacles are not obvious walls but invisible rules, internalized taboos, habitual constraints. These \"invisible barriers\" prove more formidable because we remain unconscious of their existence.",

      "textEn": "Examining Liu Jun's \"Walking with Difficulty,\" this work combines performance and installation art, differing from traditional landscape painting yet sharing fundamental principles. In landscape painting, \"journey\" serves as a vital motif—both \"Travelers Among Mountains and Streams\" and \"Early Spring\" depict figures struggling forward with difficulty. Why paint journeys. Because \"walking\" symbolizes life, \"path\" symbolizes choice, and \"landscape\" symbolizes the world. The hardships of travel—steep mountain paths, rushing streams, misty vapors—serve as metaphors for life's predicaments. Yet landscape painting's wisdom lies in this: though depicting \"difficulty,\" it contains \"passage\"—where mountains and waters seem to block the way, willows and flowers reveal another village. The paths in paintings, though winding, always offer outlets; the travelers, though small, advance with determination. This embodies the Confucian \"acting despite knowing impossibility\" and the Daoist \"wholeness through yielding. \"\n\nIf Liu Jun's work functions as performance art, the \"performing body\" becomes paramount—bodily posture, movement tempo, breathing rhythm all convey the texture of \"difficulty. \" Chinese opera employs \"stylized movements\"—specific physical techniques expressing different situations.",

      "textEn": "\"Walking with Difficulty\" recalls my longstanding concern for the suffering of laborers. The working class of the Victorian era—their very existence was \"walking with difficulty\"—enduring long hours, meager wages, wretched conditions, and no security. Their bodies bore the violence of capitalism: bent spines, roughened hands, weary eyes. If art can make the privileged classes \"see\" such hardship—not as abstract statistics, but as embodied experience—it would possess immense moral value. Should 刘坤's work be performance or installation art, the key lies in the mechanism of \"empathy\"—how to make viewers truly \"feel\" difficulty, rather than merely \"observe\" it. I suggest: engage viewers as \"participants\" rather than \"spectators. \" For instance, create real physical obstacles—viewers must navigate narrow passages, climb steep steps, walk on uneven surfaces—letting their bodies experience \"difficulty. \" This is not torturing the audience, but educating them—allowing brief experience to illuminate the prolonged struggles of countless others.",

      "textEn": "\"Walking with Difficulty\" reminds me of our ancestors' own \"walking with difficulty\" under the slave trade and colonial rule—literal \"shackles\" restricting movement, symbolic \"oppression\" restricting freedom. Yet our history is not merely suffering, but the resilience of \"walking despite difficulty\"—our ancestors survived, resisted, created, and transmitted culture under the harshest conditions. This resilience is not passive endurance, but active resistance—through preserving our languages, our rituals, our stories, we created \"possibility\" within \"impossibility. \" Liu Kun's work would be more complete if it could manifest this \"power of walking despite difficulty\"—not only the weight of \"obstacles,\" but also the courage of \"overcoming. \"\n\nIn our tradition, \"walking\" carries profound spiritual meaning—pilgrimage journeys, initiation rites, migration stories all involve difficult walking.

      "textZh": "从叙事学角度看，《举步维艰》是「受阻的叙事」(blocked narrative)——主人公想要前进，但遇到障碍。这是最古老的叙事模式之一——《奥德赛》中奥德修斯的归乡之路充满障碍，《西游记》中唐僧的取经之路历经九九八十一难。然而，重要的是：叙事的意义不在于「克服障碍」（那是结果），而在于「如何克服」（那是过程）——是通过智慧。通过力量。通过运气。通过帮助。不同的方式揭示不同的价值观。刘君的作品若是行为艺术，「表演者」如何应对障碍。是挣扎。是放弃。是寻找捷径。是改变目标。这些「应对策略」本身就是作品的意义。从俄国形式主义的「情节」(plot)理论看，障碍是「延宕」(retardation)的装置——它延缓故事的进程，创造张力和期待。",
      "textEn": "From a narratological perspective, \"Walking with Difficulty\" represents a \"blocked narrative\"—the protagonist seeks to advance but encounters obstacles. This constitutes one of the most ancient narrative patterns—Odysseus's homeward journey in *The Odyssey* is fraught with impediments, while the monk Xuanzang's pilgrimage in *Journey to the West* endures eighty-one tribulations. However, what matters crucially is this: narrative significance lies not in \"overcoming obstacles\" (that is the outcome), but in \"how to overcome them\" (that is the process)—through wisdom. Through strength. Through fortune. Through assistance. Different approaches reveal different value systems. If Liu Kun's work functions as performance art, how does the \"performer\" respond to obstacles. Through struggle. Through surrender. Through seeking shortcuts. Through changing objectives. These \"coping strategies\" themselves constitute the work's meaning. From Russian Formalism's theory of \"plot,\" obstacles serve as devices of \"retardation\"—they delay the story's progression, creating tension and expectation.",

Today, our \"movements\" are increasingly mediated by algorithms—we seek employment, but recruitment algorithms filter out our resumes; we apply for loans, but credit algorithms reject our applications; we attempt to speak, but recommendation algorithms limit our visibility. These constitute new forms of \"walking with difficulty\"—invisible, automated, seemingly neutral obstacles. Worse still, these algorithmic barriers often reinforce existing inequalities—if historical data indicates a certain demographic is \"high risk,\" algorithms impose higher barriers on that group, creating a \"self-fulfilling prophecy. \" Furthermore, \"accessibility\" assumes new meaning in the digital age—the digital barriers faced by disabled individuals (such as webpages unrecognizable to screen readers, videos without subtitles, interfaces requiring fine motor control) represent the digital version of \"walking with difficulty.",

Often, those in power design technology according to their needs and imagination, with the result that barriers for mainstream groups are eliminated while barriers for marginalized groups are ignored or even exacerbated. If 刘坤's work could explore \"visible barriers\" versus \"invisible barriers\"—physical obstacles are easily identified and addressed, while algorithmic barriers remain hidden and difficult to challenge—it would be extremely timely. I suggest considering: could we design \"algorithmic barrier visualization\"—allowing viewers to experience the sensation of \"algorithmic rejection\". For instance, viewers must pass through certain \"checkpoints,\" but the system rejects them based on randomly assigned characteristics, enabling them to experience the frustration of \"invisible discrimination.",
