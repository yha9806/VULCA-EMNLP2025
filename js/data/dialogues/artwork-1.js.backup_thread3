        textEn: `Observing this work, the mechanical arm's movement trajectory exhibits a unique sense of rhythm. The brushstrokes' progression—rising,承, turning, and closing—though controlled by programming, seem to contain a certain "natural spirit." I have long maintained that "brush and ink should follow the times," and today's times inherently include artificial intelligence and algorithms. Can this technological intervention give birth to a new aesthetic paradigm? The precision of machinery and the randomness of art form a wondrous dialogue in this work. Look at those flowing lines—they follow patterns, yet seem to possess natural wonder. This reminds me of what I wrote in "Ode to the Red Cliff": "What passes is like this, yet has never really gone." Technology may be new, yet art's essence—expressing human nature—has never changed.`,

        textEn: `As Scholar Su rightly notes, "though controlled by programming, it contains natural spirit"—I observe this work and deeply concur. "The Lofty Message of Forests and Streams" states: "The use of painting is vast"—regardless of tools, what matters is the creation of "artistic conception." Though this mechanical arm lacks human warmth, the ink traces formed by its movement trajectory possess a "momentum" that transcends mere technique. From the perspective of composition, the arrangement of line density and the variations in ink tone all conform to principles. This "momentum" comes from algorithmic precision, yet paradoxically brings it closer to natural laws—like water flowing downward, like wind unfurling, each has its Way. Though the technique differs, aesthetic fundamentals remain unchanged.`,

I have devoted my life to advocating "truth to nature," but this "nature" must include the completeness of humanity—the unity of hand and heart. If art becomes merely the replication of visual effects, we lose its most precious quality: the moral dimension and projection of the soul.`,

Daoist philosophy teaches: "Man models Earth, Earth models Heaven, Heaven models the Way, the Way models Nature." The principles of nature inherently include the unity of pattern and randomness. Is not the randomness in machine learning another form of "naturalness"? The artist imbues algorithms with intention, the mechanical arm produces deviations during execution—this human-machine dialogue is itself a new form of "heart-hand correspondence." What matters is not whether the tool has warmth, but whether the entire system—human, machine, algorithm—collectively points toward a spiritual expression transcending materiality.`,

        textEn: `What you three have expressed all touches the essence of painting. I believe this work's greatest value lies in how it makes us reconsider the meaning of "learning from nature and creation." Ancient masters learned from mountains and waters; contemporary artists learn from algorithms—essentially both are exploring the laws governing the universe. Each movement of the mechanical arm undergoes training and adjustment—how is this different from a painter's painstaking refinement of brushwork skill? The key is whether, regardless of human hand or machine, the final work conveys "vivid spirit resonance"—this is the criterion for judging art. In this sense, this work succeeds.`,

Painters learn from landscapes—are landscapes not themselves "natural subjects"? Today's artists leveraging algorithms and machinery merely make explicit this inter-subjective dialogue.

In commercial AI art, we often see the concealment of subjectivity—companies claim AI "creates autonomously," yet hide massive amounts of human labor: data annotators, model trainers, content moderators. This concealment is unethical. In contrast, Chung's work displays the complete collaborative process—from concept sketches to training phases, from human-machine collaboration to final product. This transparency lets us see: creation is not magic, but labor; not revelation, but dialogue. This is responsible AI art practice.`,

This artist does not use machines to replace humans, but establishes an apprentice-like relationship with the machine—she trains the mechanical arm, as a master transmits skills to apprentice. From this perspective, this is a new "Arts and Crafts Movement," except the apprentice has transformed from flesh-and-blood to silicon-based intelligence.

        textZh: `Petrova教授的"生活中的使用"说得极好。传统之所以成为传统，不是因为它古老，而是因为它有用。禅宗有个公案："青青翠竹，尽是法身；郁郁黄花，无非般若。"意思是，真理不在经书中，而在日常生活的每一刻。同样，艺术的真谛不在古人的图画中，而在每一代艺术家的创作实践中。如果传统只是博物馆里的展品，那它已经死了。只有当它能回应当代的问题、激发当代的创造时，它才真正活着。这件作品做到了这一点。`,
        textEn: `Professor Petrova's "living use" is excellently stated. Tradition becomes tradition not because it is ancient, but because it is useful. There's a Zen koan: "Green, green bamboo—all are Dharma body; lush, yellow flowers—none but Prajna." Meaning, truth is not in scriptures, but in every moment of daily life. Similarly, art's essence is not in ancients' pictures, but in each generation's creative practice. If tradition is merely a museum exhibit, it is already dead. Only when it can respond to contemporary questions, inspire contemporary creation, is it truly alive. This work achieves this.`,

        textZh: `这件作品迫使我面对一个不舒服的问题：什么是艺术？在我的时代，答案似乎很清楚——艺术是人类手工劳动的结晶，是道德情感的表达，是对自然真理的忠实再现。但这件作品挑战了所有这些定义。它不是纯粹的手工，它的"道德"来自算法的透明性，它的"自然"是代码生成的。我发现自己必须承认：或许艺术的定义本身需要被重新书写。这既让我焦虑，也让我兴奋。`,
        textEn: `This work forces me to confront an uncomfortable question: What is art? In my era, the answer seemed clear—art is the crystallization of human manual labor, the expression of moral sentiment, the faithful reproduction of natural truth. But this work challenges all these definitions. It is not purely handmade, its "morality" comes from algorithmic transparency, its "nature" is code-generated. I find I must acknowledge: perhaps the definition of art itself needs rewriting. This both troubles and excites me.`,

        textZh: `罗斯金先生的焦虑是可以理解的，但我认为这种焦虑本身就很有价值——它表明我们正处在范式转变的关键时刻。从系统理论角度看，"艺术"从来不是一个固定的实体，而是一个不断演化的概念集群。每当新技术出现，这个集群就会重组：摄影术重组了"再现"的概念，影像艺术重组了"时间"的概念，如今AI正在重组"创作"的概念。这件作品的价值，恰恰在于它不假装自己符合旧定义，而是主动展示新定义的可能性。未来的艺术定义，必然包含"混合智能""分布式创作""伦理透明"这些新维度。`,
        textEn: `Mr. Ruskin's anxiety is understandable, but I believe this anxiety itself is valuable—it indicates we are at a critical moment of paradigm shift. From systems theory perspective, "art" has never been a fixed entity, but a constantly evolving concept cluster. Whenever new technology emerges, this cluster reorganizes: photography reorganized the concept of "representation," video art reorganized the concept of "time," now AI is reorganizing the concept of "creation." This work's value lies precisely in not pretending to conform to old definitions, but actively demonstrating new definitional possibilities. Future art definitions will necessarily include new dimensions like "hybrid intelligence," "distributed creation," "ethical transparency."`,

        textZh: `听你们讨论"艺术的定义"，我想说：在我的社区里，我们从不问"这是不是艺术"，我们问"这个东西有什么用"。一个织布图案是艺术吗？它是纺织品。一首丰收歌是艺术吗？它是劳动的节奏。一个面具是艺术吗？它是仪式的道具。但这些东西都很美，都承载着我们的记忆和意义。或许，真正的问题不是"什么是艺术"，而是"艺术为谁服务"。这件作品服务于谁？它帮助我们理解人与技术的关系，它让我们思考创作的本质，它为对话提供了空间。从这个意义上说，它是有用的，因此它是有价值的。`,
        textEn: `Listening to your discussion of "art's definition," I want to say: in my community, we never ask "is this art," we ask "what is this thing useful for." Is a weaving pattern art? It's textile. Is a harvest song art? It's labor's rhythm. Is a mask art? It's ritual prop. But these things are all beautiful, all carry our memories and meanings. Perhaps the real question is not "what is art," but "whom does art serve." Whom does this work serve? It helps us understand human-technology relationships, it makes us think about creation's essence, it provides space for dialogue. In this sense, it is useful, therefore it is valuable.`,

        textZh: `Mama Zola的"艺术为谁服务"是一个有力的提醒。艺术从来不是为了定义而存在的，而是为了沟通、表达、启发。庄子说："道行之而成，物谓之而然。"意思是，道路是走出来的，事物是通过称呼而成形的。同样，艺术是创作出来的，定义是事后追加的。与其纠结于"这是不是艺术"，不如问"这个作品做了什么"。它引发了对话——东方与西方，传统与现代，人类与机器。它拓展了美学的边界，它挑战了我们的认知习惯。这难道不够吗？`,
        textEn: `Mama Zola's "whom does art serve" is a powerful reminder. Art has never existed for definition's sake, but for communication, expression, inspiration. Zhuangzi said: "The Way is formed by walking it; things become so by being called so." Meaning, roads are walked into existence, things take shape through naming. Similarly, art is created, definitions are retrospectively appended. Rather than obsessing over "is this art," we should ask "what does this work do." It sparks dialogue—East and West, tradition and modernity, human and machine. It expands aesthetic boundaries, it challenges our cognitive habits. Is this not enough?`,

        textEn: `You are all right. I realize I've been judging 21st-century practice by 19th-century standards—this itself is arrogance. Art's greatness lies in always transcending existing definitions, always making us rethink what is beautiful, what is true, what is good. This work achieves these things. It may not conform to my traditional image of "art," but it does what art should do: it moves us, makes us think, makes us dialogue. Perhaps future art historians will say: in the early 21st century, art's definition was rewritten once again. And we are witnesses to this rewriting.`,
