      "textEn": "Observing Li Jun and Xu Jun's 'Where Does the Wind Come From II,' the question in the title directly addresses the source. Wind is formless thing, yet its force can shake mountains, its sound can震 ears. I once composed 'Red Cliff Ode' saying 'only the clear wind on the river and bright moon among mountains'; wind and moon are both nature's gifts, cannot be possessed yet can be shared. The question 'where does wind come from' is actually 'where does Dao come from'—the universe's source, life's foundation, all things' motive power, ultimately from where. Laozi said 'the greatest sound is inaudible'; though wind's sound响, its source is silent. If this work could visually and spatially embody this dialectic of 'audible sound and inaudible source,' the realm would be profound. The character 'II' indicates this is series work, continuing some exploration. Continuity is important—like four seasons' cycle, like breathing's reciprocation; true understanding requires sustained observation and experience. I suggest designing some 'temporal' element, letting viewers feel 'wind's flow' not 'wind's stillness,' feel 'qi's change' not 'qi's fixity.",

      "textZh": "审《风从何处来·二》，其挑战在于「可视化不可见」。山水画虽画风，实不画风——画的是风吹动的树、风激起的浪、风卷起的云。风本身不可画，只能借其效果而显其存在。此谓「以实写虚」之法。二位艺术家若能深谙此理，当可创造出精妙的空间装置。建议可用「运动」表现风——飘动的布帛、摇曳的光影、流动的声音，这些「次级现象」共同构成「风」的在场。又可用「力」表现风——物体的倾斜、材料的张力、空间的压迫感，让观者身体感受到风的力量。「空气」与「能量」的主题，正合「气」之概念。山水画讲「气势」，即通过构图的动势、笔墨的力度来表现「气」的流动。此作若能在空间中营造某种「势」——引导观者的移动、控制视线的流向、调节体验的节奏——则可达到沉浸式的「气场」效果。",
      "textEn": "In examining \"Where Does the Wind Come From II,\" the central challenge lies in \"visualizing the invisible. \" In landscape painting, though we depict wind, we do not actually paint wind—we paint the trees stirred by wind, the waves roused by wind, the clouds swept by wind. Wind itself cannot be painted; its existence can only be revealed through its effects. This is what we call the method of \"expressing the void through the substantial. \"\n\nIf the two artists can deeply comprehend this principle, they should be able to create an exquisite spatial installation. I suggest employing \"movement\" to manifest wind—floating silk, swaying light and shadow, flowing sound—these \"secondary phenomena\" collectively constitute the presence of \"wind. \" They might also use \"force\" to express wind—the tilting of objects, the tension in materials, the sense of spatial compression—allowing viewers to physically sense wind's power. The themes of \"air\" and \"energy\" align perfectly with the concept of *qi*. Landscape painting emphasizes *qishi* (configurational force), expressing the flow of *qi* through compositional momentum and brushwork intensity. If this work can cultivate a certain *shi* (dynamic force) within the space—guiding viewers' movement, controlling the flow of sight, modulating the rhythm of experience—it can achieve an immersive effect of *qichang* (atmospheric field).",

      "textEn": "'Where Does the Wind Come From II' reminds me of Turner's obsession with atmospheric phenomena. In Turner's late years he almost only painted storms, mists, steam—these flowing, hard-to-capture phenomena. Critics accused him of being 'blurred,' 'unclear,' but I defended him: true reality lies not in boundary clarity but in essence's grasp. Wind, fog, qi, these 'formless forces' are precisely nature's most essential existence. However, I must ask Li Jun and Xu Jun: your exploration of 'wind,' is it based on genuine observation or conceptual imagination. Turner's greatness is because he truly tied himself to the mast in storms, truly felt steam's speed on trains, truly dwelled long in Venice's mists. His 'wind' is personally experienced wind, not study-imagined wind. Your 'wind'. If merely visual symbol wind, installation technique wind, that's only 'wind's appearance,' not 'wind's reality. ' I suggest: before making installations, first truly experience wind—go to seaside to feel sea wind, go to mountains to feel mountain wind, go to cities to feel draft.",

      "textEn": "'Where Does the Wind Come From' reminds me of our understanding of wind. In our cosmology, wind is not merely physical phenomenon but spiritual force—ancestors' breath, deities' messages, nature's language. When wind blows, we say 'ancestors are speaking. ' Therefore, the answer to 'where does wind come from' is: wind comes from ancestors, from deities, from earth. This animistic worldview is fundamentally different from modern science's explanation (pressure差, air flow). However, I don't believe scientific explanation is more 'real' than ours—it's merely another understanding method. If Li Jun and Xu Jun's work could display this 'multiple understanding' possibility—wind is both physical and spiritual, both scientific and poetic, both individual sensation and collective memory—it would be very enlightening. In our tradition, wind also has 'transmission' function—it transmits seeds, transmits smells, transmits sounds. Wind's fluidity symbolizes knowledge's transmission, cultural exchange, human-to-human connection.",

      "textEn": "From a formalist perspective, \"Where Does the Wind Come From II\" presents a challenge to \"unrepresentability. \" Wind is colorless and formless—how can it be represented. This problem exists in literature as well—how does one describe music through words. How does language convey silence. Russian Formalism offers this answer: do not attempt \"direct representation,\" but employ \"indirect devices. \" For instance, instead of writing \"the wind is strong,\" write \"the trees are bent\"; instead of \"the music is beautiful,\" write \"the audience wept. \" This method of \"substituting effect for essence\" constitutes art's core technique. Should Li and Xu master this approach, they could create powerful installations. However, I am more concerned with the designation \"II\"—this suggests a strategy of \"seriality. \" Shklovsky analyzed the formal characteristics of serial novels: each part is both independent and interconnected, both repetitive and variable. \"Repetition\" creates familiarity, \"variation\" creates defamiliarization, and their combination produces unique aesthetic effects.",

Modern meteorology predicts wind through massive sensors, satellite data, AI models—this is the scientific answer to 'where does wind come from. ' However, is this answer complete.
