The juxtaposition creates strong tension: precious texts becoming 'non-existent' things. This is precisely the digital age's paradox—information explosion and information disappearance coexist. I once said 'what does human life resemble wherever one goes. It should resemble wild geese treading on snow-covered mud. By chance they leave claw marks in the mud, but when the geese fly away, who still cares about east or west. ' Today's internet content, isn't it the same. At publication seems eternal, at deletion leaves no trace. Yet I believe 'disappearance' is not necessarily bad. Buddhism has the saying 'neither arising nor ceasing,' Daoism has the principle 'existence and non-existence mutually generate'—existence and disappearance, manifestation and concealment, are fundamentally two sides of one. Today's people excessively cling to 'permanent preservation,' instead losing the wisdom of 'letting go.

Landscape painting emphasizes 'leaving blank'—blank space is not emptiness but where spirit resonance resides, imagination's space. This work handling '404' (disappeared content) precisely can reference this method—need not attempt to 'fill' or 'restore' disappeared text, instead should display 'absence' itself. Absence's shape, absence's traces, absence's left blank spaces, these themselves are part of the work. Like broken steles and ruined tablets, their value lies not in original completeness but in imprints left by time. Also, 'fragments' arrangement can reference 'scattered perspective' method—not single viewpoint but multiple fragments each independent yet faintly echoing, like relationships between various scenes in landscape handscrolls.

The digital age's '404' has similarities—when a website closes, a platform disappears, that content also like untransmitted oral history, vanishes into void. However, there are also differences: oral history's disappearance is natural (human lifespan limited), while digital content's disappearance is often artificial, sudden, violent (censorship, deletion, platform collapse).
