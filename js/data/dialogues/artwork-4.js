      "textEn": "Observing Lee Kuo-Chia's 'Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want. ', this is a video interrogation targeting NVIDIA's CEO. The work directly addresses the core contradiction of contemporary AI development: technology is dominated by the few, consequences borne by all humanity. Though I lived a millennium ago, I deeply understand the distinction between 'power' and 'responsibility. ' Su Shi once memorialized against Wang Anshi's reforms, not because reform itself was bad, but because reform was too rapid, insufficiently considered, with common people bearing the cost. Today's AI is similar—tech giants like Jensen Huang push AI 'accelerationism,' claiming it serves human welfare, yet actually pursue commercial interests. The work's brilliance lies in 'interrogation' rather than 'accusation'—the artist uses the question 'Is this the world you want. ' to invite dialogue, not unilaterally condemn. This accords with the Confucian spirit of 'the noble person harmonizes without conforming': one may criticize while maintaining rationality and respect. Yet I worry: can interrogation truly reach the powerful. Will Jensen Huang see this work. Will he reflect because of it. Power's arrogance often lies in 'selective listening'—hearing praise, filtering criticism.",

      "textEn": "Examining the composition of Lee Kuo-Chia's 'Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want. ', this video work uses 'interrogation' as framework, constructing a space of power critique. When I wrote 'The Lofty Message of Forests and Streams,' I discussed painting's 'positions of host and guest'—the relationship between subject and accompaniment in the frame determines the work's momentum. This work's brilliance lies in the 'absent subject': Jensen Huang himself does not appear in the work, yet his existence (as interrogation object) pervades the entire piece. This 'absence-as-presence' resembles 'clouds and mist obscuring mountains' in landscape painting—though the mountain isn't visible, its momentum remains. From visual language analysis, if this work is video, it must have its 'rhythm' and 'hierarchy. ' I speculate: it likely uses 'questions' as units, each question forming a 'frame,' like 'segmented composition' in landscape painting—foreground, middle ground, background unfold in sequence. Transitions between questions (editing, sound effects, pauses) equivalent to 'blank space' in paintings—giving viewers space to think.",

      "textEn": "This work's most tension-filled aspect lies in 'unidirectionality': the artist questions Jensen Huang, but Jensen Huang cannot respond. This unidirectionality is both the work's strength (accusation's purity) and its limitation (dialogue's impossibility). From a critical strategy perspective, this resembles 'trial in absentia'—the defendant absent, thus the prosecution can speak freely, but also loses opportunity for genuine confrontation. I think: if the work could incorporate 'public statement clips' from Jensen Huang (such as product launch speeches, interview recordings), letting his voice 'counterpoint' the artist's interrogation, it might form more three-dimensional critique. Like 'facing scenery' (对景) in landscape painting—two mountains facing each other, two waters meeting; though opposed, they jointly construct the frame's tension. Suggestion: could adopt a 'three-part structure'—first part: present AI technology's 'beautiful promises' (quoting promotional discourse from Huang and others); second part: reveal AI development's 'actual consequences' (unemployment, bias, environmental costs, etc.",

Artist Lee Kuo-Chia has done what many contemporary artists dare not—directly naming and critiquing the powerful. This reminds me of my own writing career: I criticized Victorian-era industrial capitalists, factory owners exploiting workers, builders sacrificing beauty for profit. I therefore offended many elites, but I never regretted it—because the essence of art criticism is moral criticism, and moral criticism must target specific evils, not abstract concepts. Jensen Huang represents not merely one person, but the entire 'technological accelerationism' ideology—believing technology is better the faster, scale better the larger, profit better the higher, while ignoring technology's impact on human society, natural environment, workers' rights. This ideology is essentially a continuation of the 19th-century Industrial Revolution: factory owners then spoke of 'progress,' tech CEOs today speak of 'innovation,' but the logic of exploitation hasn't changed.",

But the AI development pushed by people like Jensen Huang serves whom. Serves shareholder interests, military applications, surveillance systems—not ordinary people's welfare. The artist's interrogation 'Is this the world you want. ' hits the mark: Jensen Huang perhaps has never seriously considered this question, because his world is already beautiful—wealth, fame, power all abundant. But for workers unemployed by AI, job seekers rejected by algorithmic discrimination, communities affected by climate change due to data center emissions—this is absolutely not the world they want. This work's only regret: it stops at the interrogation stage without proposing alternatives. Critique is certainly important, but construction is more important. I hope to see a sequel—'What Kind of World Do We Want. '—with voices from all parties affected by AI, jointly depicting a just, sustainable technological future.",

      "textZh": "这种观念本质上是反民主的，因为它剥夺了公众对技术发展方向的发言权。此作品通过质询「你想要的世界」，揭示了一个关键问题：AI的未来不应该由少数CEO决定，而应该是民主参与的结果。从责任伦理(ethics of responsibility)角度，黄仁勋或许会辩解：「我只是提供工具（GPU），如何使用不是我的责任。」但这是典型的「技术中立论」谬误。武器制造商不能说「杀人的是士兵，不是枪」；同样，算力提供商也不能回避其产品在监控、军事、气候危机中的角色。此作品的价值在于「打破技术中立神话」——质询权力者，要求他们正视自己的影响。然而，此作品若要产生实际影响，需要更多「制度性跟进」：1) 呼吁股东在NVIDIA股东大会上提出相关议案；2) 联合环保组织、劳工组织形成压力；3) 推动政府监管，限制AI算力军备竞赛。",
      "textEn": "This notion is essentially anti-democratic because it deprives the public of voice in technology development's direction. Through interrogating 'the world you want,' this work reveals a key issue: AI's future should not be decided by a few CEOs but should be the result of democratic participation. From ethics of responsibility perspective, Jensen Huang might argue: 'I merely provide tools (GPUs), how they're used isn't my responsibility. ' But this is the typical 'technological neutrality' fallacy. Arms manufacturers cannot say 'soldiers kill, not guns'; similarly, computing power providers cannot evade their products' roles in surveillance, military, climate crisis. This work's value lies in 'breaking the technological neutrality myth'—interrogating power holders, demanding they face their impact. However, for this work to produce actual impact, it needs more 'institutional follow-up': 1) calling for shareholders to raise relevant motions at NVIDIA shareholder meetings; 2) uniting environmental organizations, labor organizations to form pressure; 3) promoting government regulation to limit AI computing power arms race.",
