      "textZh": "观三位艺术家《双生界》，「双生」二字引人深思。庄子有「齐物论」，言「天地与我并生，而万物与我为一」，又有「庄周梦蝶」之典——不知是庄周梦蝶，还是蝶梦庄周。此正是「双生」之境——两个世界、两种身份、两重真实，彼此映照、难分主次。佛教讲「色即是空，空即是色」,现实与虚幻本是一体两面，执着于区分反而迷失。此作「通过镜子、投影与空间干预创造平行世界和双重现实」——镜子，自古以来就是哲学的隐喻。古希腊哲学家用镜子讨论「再现」的本质，柏拉图认为艺术如同镜子，只是「理念的影子的影子」。然禅宗却说「明镜亦非台」——连镜子本身都是虚妄，何况镜中之像。此作之高明在于：不是简单地制造「双重世界」的视觉效果，而是让观者在两个世界之间「游走」、「迷失」、「质疑」——哪个是真实。",
      "textEn": "Observing \"Twin Realms\" by the three artists 向诗雨, 陈晨, and 王思莹, the term \"twin realms\" invites profound contemplation. Zhuangzi's \"Discourse on the Equality of Things\" states: \"Heaven, earth, and I exist together, and all things and I are one. \" There is also the parable of \"Zhuangzi's Butterfly Dream\"—who can say whether Zhuangzi dreamed of being a butterfly, or the butterfly dreamed of being Zhuangzi. This precisely captures the境界 of \"twin realms\"—two worlds, two identities, two layers of reality, reflecting each other while defying hierarchical distinction. Buddhism teaches \"form is emptiness, emptiness is form\"—reality and illusion are but two faces of one essence; clinging to their separation leads only to delusion. This work \"creates parallel worlds and dual reality through mirrors, projections, and spatial intervention. \" The mirror has long served as philosophical metaphor. Ancient Greek philosophers employed mirrors to discuss the nature of representation; Plato deemed art mirror-like, merely \"shadows of shadows of the ideal.",

      "textZh": "审三位合作者《双生界》，其「镜子、投影、空间干预」之技法,让吾想起山水画中的「倒影」。水中倒影是「自然的镜子」——山、树、月在水中形成另一个世界。然中国画家不仅是复制倒影，而是通过倒影来表现「气」的流动、「意」的延伸。倒影模糊时，表现水的动荡；倒影清晰时，表现水的平静。倒影不是山的「复制品」，而是山的「另一种存在」。三位艺术家之挑战在于：如何让「双生界」不仅是视觉的镜像，更是意义的扩展。吾建议几点：（1）**不对称的镜像**——真实与镜像不完全相同，某些细节被放大、某些被省略、某些被扭曲，这创造了「熟悉的陌生感」。（2）**延时的投影**——投影与真实有时间差，暗示「时间」在两个世界中流动速度不同。",
      "textEn": "Upon examining the collaboration \"Twin Realms\" by 向诗雨, 陈晨, and 王思莹, their techniques of \"mirrors, projections, and spatial intervention\" remind me of the \"reflections\" in landscape painting. Water reflections serve as \"nature's mirrors\"—mountains, trees, and moon form another world within the water. Yet Chinese painters do not merely copy reflections, but use them to express the flow of \"qi\" and the extension of \"yi\" (artistic conception). When reflections blur, they express water's turbulence; when clear, they express water's tranquility. Reflections are not \"copies\" of mountains, but \"another mode of existence\" for mountains. The challenge for these three artists lies in: how to make \"Twin Realms\" not merely a visual mirror, but an expansion of meaning. I suggest several approaches: (1) **Asymmetrical mirroring**—reality and mirror-image are not identical; certain details are magnified, others omitted, some distorted, creating \"familiar strangeness. \" (2) **Delayed projection**—projections have temporal lag with reality, suggesting \"time\" flows at different speeds in the two worlds.",

      "textZh": "《双生界》的镜像主题让我想起维多利亚时代对「反射」的迷恋——镜子、玻璃、水晶宫，这些技术展示了工业文明的成就，但也揭示了其虚幻性。我曾批评「虚假的装饰」和「欺骗的表象」，认为艺术必须「忠实于材料的本质」。镜子是最「欺骗」的材料——它创造了不存在的空间、复制了虚幻的形象。然而，我也必须承认，镜子可以成为批判的工具——通过镜像，我们看到现实的「另一面」,看到习以为常的事物变得陌生。三位艺术家若能用镜像来揭示社会现实的双重性——表象与真相的差距、公开与隐藏的对立、承诺与实践的矛盾——则作品将有批判力量。例如，一面是华丽的消费空间，镜中却是生产这些商品的血汗工厂；一面是美丽的自然景观，镜中却是被污染的工业废墟。",
      "textEn": "The mirror theme of \"Twin Realms\" recalls the Victorian era's fascination with \"reflection\"—mirrors, glass, the Crystal Palace—these technological displays demonstrated industrial civilization's achievements while revealing its illusory nature. I have long criticized \"false decoration\" and \"deceptive appearances,\" believing art must remain \"faithful to the essential nature of materials. \" The mirror is the most \"deceptive\" of materials—it creates non-existent spaces, reproduces phantom images. Yet I must acknowledge that mirrors can serve as instruments of critique—through reflection, we perceive the \"other side\" of reality, witnessing familiar things rendered strange. Should these three artists employ mirroring to expose social reality's duality—the chasm between appearance and truth, the opposition of public and hidden, the contradiction between promise and practice—their work would possess critical power. Imagine: one side displays luxurious commercial spaces, while the mirror reveals the sweatshops producing these goods; one side shows beautiful natural landscapes, while the mirror exposes polluted industrial ruins.",

      "textEn": "\"Twin Realms\" reminds me of the relationship between the \"visible world\" and the \"invisible world\" in our cosmology. In our tradition, these are not two separate worlds, but two dimensions of the same reality—the world of ancestors and the world of the living, the realm of spirits and the material realm, interwoven and influencing each other. When we perform rituals, we open passages between the two worlds; when we dance, our bodies become bridges between the two worlds. The three artists' use of \"mirrors and projections\" reminds me of water—in our tradition, water is the interface between two worlds. When we gaze into water's surface, we see not only our own reflection, but also the faces of ancestors, the omens of the future. Water is both physical and spiritual. However, I must remind: the Western concept of \"mirroring\" often implies \"copying,\" \"simulation,\" \"falseness,\" while our \"dual worlds\" are not an opposition between true and false, but different layers of reality.",

      "textZh": "从结构主义角度看，《双生界》探索的是「二元对立」(binary opposition)结构——列维-斯特劳斯认为人类思维是通过二元对立来组织世界的：自然/文化、生/熟、左/右、上/下。「双生界」可以理解为对这种结构的视觉化展示。然而，后结构主义（特别是德里达）质疑了二元对立的稳定性——他提出「延异」(différance)概念，指出二元对立中的两项并非平等，总有一项被特权化。例如，在「真实/镜像」对立中，「真实」被认为是原初的、本质的，而「镜像」是次级的、派生的。德里达的「解构」策略是颠覆这种等级——证明「真实」也依赖于「镜像」来定义自身。三位艺术家若能在装置中实践这种「解构」——让观者无法确定哪个是「原件」哪个是「副本」，哪个是「真实」哪个是「投影」——将实现深刻的哲学批判。",
      "textEn": "From a structuralist perspective, \"Twin Realms\" explores the structure of \"binary opposition\"—Lévi-Strauss argued that human thinking organizes the world through binary oppositions: nature/culture, raw/cooked, left/right, up/down. \"Twin Realms\" can be understood as a visualization of this structure. However, post-structuralism (particularly Derrida) questions the stability of binary oppositions—he proposed the concept of \"différance,\" pointing out that the two terms in binary opposition are not equal, with one always being privileged. For example, in the \"real/mirror image\" opposition, the \"real\" is considered primordial and essential, while the \"mirror image\" is secondary and derivative. Derrida's \"deconstruction\" strategy is to subvert this hierarchy—proving that the \"real\" also depends on the \"mirror image\" to define itself. If the three artists could practice this \"deconstruction\" in their installation—making viewers unable to determine which is \"original\" and which is \"copy,\" which is \"real\" and which is \"projection\"—they would achieve profound philosophical critique.",
