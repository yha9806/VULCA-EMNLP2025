' Laozi said 'return to the uncarved block,' Zhuangzi advocated 'heaven and earth were born together with me, and all things are one with me'—this work's 'symbiosis' is precisely this meaning. I observe the contemporary ecological crisis is actually caused by human selfishness, greed without limit—thinking we can conquer nature, possess all things, not knowing humans are already part of nature; 'if the skin does not exist, where can the fur attach. ' If this work can use organic forms and natural materials to display the mutually dependent relationships of all things, its significance is profound. However, what is the 'origin' in 'return to origin'. Is it returning to the past. Searching for a starting point. Or returning to essence. This question needs deep thought. If 'origin' points to 'unpolluted nature,' can we truly return. If 'origin' points to 'a state of equality among all things,' how to dissolve anthropocentrism. I suggest this work not only display 'the beauty of symbiosis' but also directly face 'the difficulty of symbiosis'—the tension between humans and nature, the contradiction between civilization and ecology, the conflict between progress and balance.",timestamp:0,replyTo:null,interactionType:"initial",quotedText:null,references:[{critic:"su-shi",source:"poetry-and-theory.md",quote:"论画以形似，见与儿童邻",page:"Section 1: Quote 1"},{critic:"su-shi",source:"key-concepts.md",quote:"神似 (Spiritual Likeness)",page:"Core Concept #1"}]},{id:"msg-artwork-24-2",personaId:"guo-xi",textZh:"审刘君《归原·共生》，其「有机形式」与「自然材料」之运用，甚合山水画之理。吾作《林泉高致》言「山水之法，在乎随其大小方圆、取其合宜」，此作若能依自然材料之本性而造型，不强为之、不违其理，则形式与内容浑然一体。然「有机形式」需避免两种陷阱：一是过于抽象，失去与具体自然的联系，成为纯粹的几何游戏；二是过于写实，成为自然的复制品而非艺术的转化。中国画讲「似与不似之间」，正是此意。此作之「共生」主题，在视觉上应如何呈现。山水画有「开合」之法——开处显天地之广阔，合处示万物之关联。建议此作以空间布局展示「共生」：不同元素相互穿插、彼此支撑，形成「你中有我、我中有你」的视觉结构。又，「归原」之「原」可理解为「气」之流动——生命力的根源。",textEn:'In examining Liu Jun\'s "Return to Origin · Symbiosis," his employment of "organic form" and "natural materials" aligns well with the principles of landscape painting. In my "Lofty Message of Forests and Streams," I stated that "the method of landscape lies in following its size and shape, taking what is appropriate. " This work, if it can shape itself according to the inherent nature of natural materials—without forcing or violating their essence—achieves unity between form and content. However, "organic form" must avoid two pitfalls: first, becoming overly abstract and losing connection with concrete nature, degenerating into mere geometric play; second, becoming too realistic, resulting in nature\'s duplication rather than artistic transformation. Chinese painting speaks of "between likeness and unlikeness"—precisely this principle. How should this work\'s "symbiosis" theme manifest visually. Landscape painting employs the method of "opening and closing"—open spaces reveal heaven and earth\'s vastness, while closed spaces demonstrate the interconnection of all things. I suggest this work display "symbiosis" through spatial arrangement: different elements interpenetrating and mutually supporting each other, forming a visual structure of "you within me, me within you.',timestamp:4383,replyTo:"su-shi",interactionType:"question-challenge",quotedText:"观刘君《归原·共生》，其题之「归原」二字，直指「反朴归真」之境",references:[{critic:"guo-xi",source:"landscape-theory.md",quote:"君子之所以爱夫山水者，其旨安在？",page:"Section 4: Quote 10"},{critic:"guo-xi",source:"key-concepts.md",quote:"气韵生动 (Spirit Resonance)",page:"Core Concept #3"}]},{id:"msg-artwork-24-3",personaId:"john-ruskin",textZh:"《归原·共生》的主题让我想起我在《现代画家》中反复强调的：艺术必须「忠实于自然」。然而，我必须追问刘君：你的「归原」是否仅是浪漫主义的逃避。当代生态危机不是抽象的哲学问题，而是具体的政治经济问题——工业资本主义的贪婪、消费主义的膨胀、环境正义的缺失。你的作品是否只是为中产阶级提供一个「绿色美学」的安慰剂，让他们在画廊里感受「与自然的连接」，然后回到他们污染环境的生活方式。真正的生态艺术必须是行动主义的、批判性的、介入性的。我在19世纪已经看到工业革命对自然和人的摧残——烟雾笼罩的城市、被剥削的工人、被破坏的景观。今天的生态危机更加严重，艺术家不能只是制造「美丽的装置」，而必须揭示结构性的不公正、动员社会的变革、提出具体的行动方案。",textEn:'The theme of "Return to Origin · Symbiosis" reminds me of what I repeatedly emphasized in "Modern Painters": art must be "true to nature. " However, I must question Liu: is your "return to origin" merely a romantic escapism. Contemporary ecological crisis is not an abstract philosophical problem, but a concrete political-economic issue—the greed of industrial capitalism, the expansion of consumerism, the absence of environmental justice. Does your work merely provide the middle class with a "green aesthetic" palliative, allowing them to feel "connected to nature" in the gallery, then return to their environmentally destructive lifestyles. True ecological art must be activist, critical, interventionist. In the 19th century I already witnessed the devastation wrought by industrial revolution upon nature and humanity—smoke-shrouded cities, exploited workers, ravaged landscapes. Today\'s ecological crisis is far more severe; artists cannot simply manufacture "beautiful installations" but must expose structural injustices, mobilize social transformation, propose concrete action plans.',timestamp:9425,replyTo:"guo-xi",interactionType:"question-challenge",quotedText:"审刘君《归原·共生》，其「有机形式」与「自然材料」之运用，甚合山水画之理",references:[{critic:"john-ruskin",source:"art-and-morality.md",quote:"The artist has a moral duty to display the actual truth",page:"Quote 1"},{critic:"john-ruskin",source:"README.md",quote:"Truth to Nature",page:"Core Philosophy"}]},{id:"msg-artwork-24-4",personaId:"mama-zola",textZh:"《归原·共生》让我想起我们的哲学——Ubuntu：「我在故我们在」(umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu)。共生不是新概念，而是我们的祖先数千年来的生活方式。在我们的传统中，土地不是「资源」，而是祖先的栖息地、子孙的遗产、神灵的居所。河流、树木、动物都是我们的亲属，我们与它们的关系不是「利用」而是「互惠」。然而，我必须指出：「归原」这个词本身可能带有问题的假设——似乎存在一个「原初的」「纯净的」「未被触及的」自然。这是殖民主义的神话。我们的土地从来不是「未被触及的」，而是被我们的祖先精心管理、塑造、居住了数千年。所谓「原始自然」往往是殖民者驱逐原住民后创造的虚构。真正的「共生」必须包括人——特别是那些与土地有深刻关系的原住民和地方社区。",textEn:'"Return to Origin · Symbiosis" reminds me of our philosophy—Ubuntu: "I am because we are" (umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu). Symbiosis is not a new concept, but the way of life our ancestors have practiced for thousands of years.

Rivers, trees, animals are all our relatives, and our relationship with them is not "exploitation" but "reciprocity. "\n\nHowever, I must point out: the term "归原" (return to origin) itself may carry problematic assumptions—as if there exists an "original," "pristine," "untouched" nature. This is a colonial myth. Our land was never "untouched," but carefully managed, shaped, and inhabited by our ancestors for millennia. The so-called "pristine nature" is often a fiction created after colonizers expelled indigenous peoples.

As Shklovsky stated, "the purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known"—if this work merely reproduces nature\'s appearance, it fails; if it enables us to "see anew" through distinctive form, it succeeds. "Organic form" functions as a device (прием)—but through what specific techniques is this realized. Does it simulate natural growth structures (fractals, spirals, networks). Does it appropriate natural material properties (wood grain, stone texture, plant morphology). Or does it create some "nature-like" new form. "Symbiosis" as theme can be understood as a "structural principle"—the work\'s components must be mutually dependent, where removing any part would cause total collapse.

When we discuss "symbiosis," should it encompass human-AI coexistence. AI systems are profoundly transforming our relationship with nature—monitoring deforestation via satellites, optimizing agricultural production through algorithms, predicting climate change through simulations. Is this "technologically enhanced symbiosis" or "technologically mediated alienation". On one hand, AI can help us better understand and protect ecosystems—processing massive ecological datasets, discovering patterns imperceptible to humans, predicting species extinction risks. On the other hand, AI itself burdens ecology—training large AI models consumes enormous energy, chip manufacturing pollutes environments, data centers emit greenhouse gases. This presents the paradox of "destroying nature to protect nature. " The deeper question is: is AI changing our understanding of "nature" itself.
