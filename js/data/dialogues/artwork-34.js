      "textZh": "观郭君《方城市》，其以「几何严谨性」规划城市空间，让吾想起《周礼·考工记》所载「匠人营国，方九里，旁三门」——中国古代理想城市规划正是方正格局。然「方」有双重含义：其一为「形式」（方形、直角、网格），其二为「秩序」（规矩、法度、等级）。方城不仅是空间的形状，更是权力的体现——帝王居中、官民分区、礼制昭彰。郭君此作探讨「网格系统与正交规划如何塑造移动、感知与社会组织」，触及城市的本质——城市不是自然生长的有机体，而是人为设计的权力装置。然而，吾必须指出：过度的「方」会压抑生命的「圆」。道家讲「大方无隅」——真正的方反而没有棱角，因为它包容万物、不刻意规整。儒家虽重礼制，但孔子也说「绘事后素」——先有真诚的本质，才有外在的形式。",
      "textEn": "Contemplating Master Guo's \"Square City,\" I observe how its \"geometric rigor\" organizes urban space, which recalls the *Zhouli Kaogongji*'s prescription: \"The craftsman constructs the state capital as a square of nine li, with three gates on each side\"—ancient China's ideal city planning indeed followed square formations. Yet \"square\" (fang) carries dual meaning: first as \"form\" (square shape, right angles, grids), second as \"order\" (rules, laws, hierarchy). The square city is not merely spatial configuration, but embodiment of power—the emperor at center, officials and commoners segregated, ritual propriety manifest. Master Guo's work explores \"how grid systems and orthogonal planning shape movement, perception, and social organization,\" touching upon the city's essence—cities are not naturally growing organisms, but artificially designed apparatus of power. However, I must note: excessive \"squareness\" suppresses life's \"roundness. \" Daoists teach that \"the great square has no corners\"—true squareness paradoxically lacks sharp edges, for it embraces all things without forced regularity. Though Confucians value ritual order, Confucius himself said \"painting comes after the plain ground\"—authentic essence must precede external form.",

      "textZh": "审郭君《方城市》，此为建筑视野之城市规划。然中国画论对「城市」的描绘甚少——吾等多画自然山水，而非人工城市。为何。因为山水代表道之自然，而城市代表人之造作。《林泉高致》虽未论城市，但其空间理论可资借鉴。吾讲「三远」——平远、深远、高远，这是自然空间的层次；城市空间是否也可有类似的「层次」。表层是可见的建筑与街道，深层是不可见的权力与规则。「网格系统」如同绘画的「界画」技法——用界尺画直线，构建建筑的精确透视。界画的代表如李思训的《明皇幸蜀图》，其中宫殿楼阁工整严谨。然界画的局限在于：过于工整则缺少气韵。郭君的「方城市」若只是几何的展示，则失去艺术性；若能在几何中透露人的痕迹——使用的磨损、时间的痕迹、意外的变化——则形式与生命结合。",
      "textEn": "Examining Master Guo's \"Square City,\" this presents an architectural vision of urban planning. Yet Chinese painting theory rarely addresses the depiction of \"cities\"—we predominantly paint natural landscapes, not artificial urban spaces. Why. Because landscapes represent the natural Way (dao), while cities represent human artifice. Though my \"Lofty Message of Forest and Streams\" does not discuss cities, its spatial theories offer valuable insight. I speak of \"three distances\" (sanyuan)—level distance, deep distance, and high distance—these are the layers of natural space; might urban space also possess similar \"layers\". The surface layer consists of visible buildings and streets, while the deep layer contains invisible power structures and regulations. The \"grid system\" resembles the jiehua (ruled-line painting) technique in painting—using rulers to draw straight lines, constructing precise architectural perspective. Jiehua masters like Li Sixun's \"Emperor Minghuang's Journey to Shu\" display palaces and pavilions with meticulous precision. However, jiehua's limitation lies in this: excessive regularity lacks spirit resonance (qiyun). If Master Guo's \"Square City\" merely displays geometry, it loses artistic quality; yet if it can reveal human traces within geometry—wear from usage, marks of time, accidental variations—then form unites with life.",

      "textEn": "\"Square City\" reminds me of my profound critique of modern urban planning. The industrial cities of the 19th century—Manchester, Birmingham, London's industrial districts—were early versions of the \"Square City\": grid-pattern workers' housing, standardized factories, straight roads. The purpose of such planning was not human happiness, but production efficiency—transforming people into machine appendages, cities into vast factories. I have opposed this dehumanizing planning throughout my life, advocating a return to the organic nature of medieval cities—those winding alleys, irregular squares, distinctive buildings that were products of time, expressions of community, dwellings of humanity. What values does 郭姸瑩's \"grid system\" represent. Efficiency above all. Order above all. Control above all. If so, I must oppose it. Cities should serve human development in its entirety—not merely productive, but also aesthetic, social, spiritual. Grid systems facilitate surveillance, management, standardization, but they suppress diversity, spontaneity, creativity.",

      "textEn": "\"Square City\" reminds me of colonial urban planning—the cities that European colonizers established in Africa, Asia, and the Americas were all \"square cities\": straight roads, orderly blocks, segregated ethnic groups. Such planning was not a neutral technical choice, but a tool of power—controlling people through space, suppressing culture through geometry. Our traditional towns were not \"square\"—they grew organically, adapted to terrain, formed around community centers (wells, great trees, plazas). The colonizers came and imposed grid systems, calling this \"modernization\" and \"civilization,\" but in reality it was the erasure of our spatial memory, the destruction of our social structures. \"Orthogonal planning\" implies \"correct\" and \"orthodox\" spatial organization—but who defines what is \"correct\". Why are straight lines more \"correct\" than curved ones. Why are squares more \"civilized\" than circles. These are all cultural biases disguised as universal standards. If Guo could reveal the colonial nature of \"square cities\"—how they were used to control colonized populations, how they destroyed existing urban fabric, how they imposed foreign spatial logic—it would be extremely valuable.",

      "textEn": "From a semiotic perspective, the \"square\" and \"grid\" in *Square City* function as powerful signifiers—bearing the signified meanings of \"order,\" \"rationality,\" and \"modernity. \" In *Tristes Tropiques*, Lévi-Strauss distinguished between \"cold societies\" and \"hot societies\"—the former being static, repetitive, and resistant to change, while the latter are dynamic, innovative, and embracing of history. Which category does Square City belong to. Its \"geometric rigor\" suggests it is \"cold\"—freezing time through the eternality of the grid. However, Foucault's theory of \"disciplinary space\" proves more applicable—in *Discipline and Punish*, he analyzed how modern institutions (prisons, schools, hospitals, factories) discipline bodies through spatial arrangement. Square City represents an amplified version of such discipline—through the grid system, power achieves \"panopticon\"—every block becomes visible, every individual locatable, every action monitorable.",
