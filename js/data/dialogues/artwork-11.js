      "textEn": "Observing Chen Jun's 'The House of Time: Calculated Genealogical Memory,' the title already contains deep meaning—using 'house' to metaphorize genealogy, 'calculation' to metaphorize digitization, 'time' to thread through past and present. I once said 'essays are like homes, having halls and courtyards'; this work also views genealogy as 'home,' each generation like one room, generations passing like buildings stacking. Yet the two characters 'calculation' are quite thought-provoking—can algorithms truly understand bloodlines. Can data truly carry memory. I wrote 'Night Excursion to Chengtian Temple,' merely over a hundred characters, yet transmitted through millennia; if analyzed by algorithms, can it capture its spirit resonance. Family memory's preciousness lies not merely in genealogical information like 'who is whose son' but in living, warm stories like 'how grandfather instructed father,' 'how mother transmitted skills. ' These subtleties, algorithms fear cannot capture. Yet I also acknowledge digitization truly has value—it can preserve, organize, present massive genealogical data, which traditional paper genealogies cannot do.",

      "textEn": "Examining 'The House of Time's' composition, if viewed as architectural elevation, it possesses considerable organizational principles. Genealogy itself is a 'vertical' structure—from ancestors to descendants, from past to future; this verticality visually can correspond to architecture's 'floors. ' I once discussed landscape painting has the 'high distance' method—from mountain base looking up to mountain peak, layer upon layer, displaying its height. Genealogy's 'temporal depth' can also use this method—the higher up (older ancestors) the more abstract, blurred, like distant mountains without texture; the lower down (closer descendants) the more specific, clear, like near trees with branches. This 'clarity gradient' can express time's erosion of memory, also express information transmission loss between generations. The 'house' metaphor can also be further developed—different rooms can have different 'functions' (main hall is family major events, bedroom is private memories, kitchen is life details), different floors can have different 'eras' (first floor is Qing dynasty, second floor is Republic, third floor is contemporary); this spatial zoning can help viewers understand complex genealogical relationships.",

' In the 19th century, I witnessed the Industrial Revolution's destruction of handicraft—machines mass-producing cheap goods, but these goods lack 'human traces,' lack makers' love and dignity. Does today's digitized genealogy also face the same problem. Traditional genealogies were handwritten, transcribed, transmitted by family members; each unique, carrying compilers' emotions and memories. While algorithm-generated genealogies, though precise, efficient, can they carry emotion. Can they embody respect. I must ask: is Chen Jun 'preserving' family memory or 'transforming' family memory. If the former, then digitization is merely preservation means; the key still lies in original, human memory. If the latter, then we need to be clear: what is transformation's cost. What is retained. What is lost. In 'The Stones of Venice' I wrote: every stone records craftsmen's labor, carries a segment of history.",

      "textZh": "《时间的房子》让我想起我们口述家族历史的传统。在我们的文化中，没有「族谱」这种书面记录，但这不意味着我们不重视家族记忆——恰恰相反，我们通过griot（说书人）口口相传，将家族历史、部落历史、祖先事迹代代传承。这种口述传统与书面族谱的根本区别在于：口述是活的、变化的、参与式的。每一次讲述都是一次重新创造，讲述者会根据听众、场合、需要调整内容。而书面族谱（以及数字族谱）是固定的、静态的、权威的。两种方式各有优劣，但我想提醒陈君：不要以为「记录下来」就等于「保存下来」。真正的记忆保存，需要不断的「使用」「讲述」「传承」——一本从不被打开的族谱，即使保存完好，也是死的。因此，陈君的作品若能设计某种「互动」机制——让观者可以添加自己的家族故事、可以连接不同的家族网络、可以参与到族谱的「共同创作」中——将更有生命力。",
      "textEn": "'The House of Time' reminds me of our tradition of oral family history. In our culture, there is no 'genealogy' as written record, but this doesn't mean we don't value family memory—quite the contrary, we through griot (storytellers) transmit orally, passing down family history, tribal history, ancestral deeds through generations. This oral tradition's fundamental difference from written genealogy is: oral is living, changing, participatory. Each telling is a recreation; tellers adjust content according to audience, occasion, need. While written genealogies (and digital genealogies) are fixed, static, authoritative. Both methods have merits, but I want to remind Chen Jun: don't think 'recording' equals 'preserving. ' True memory preservation requires constant 'using,' 'telling,' 'transmitting'—a genealogy never opened, even if well-preserved, is dead. Therefore, if Chen Jun's work could design some 'interactive' mechanism—letting viewers add their own family stories, connect different family networks, participate in genealogy's 'co-creation'—it would be more vital.",

From a formalist perspective, 'data visualization' itself is a 'device' (прием)—it transforms abstract data (numbers, text) into concrete visual (charts, images); this transformation process is 'defamiliarization'—originally only rationally understandable genealogical relationships can now be sensually 'seen. ' However, Shklovsky reminds us: the device should not be concealed but 'laid bare. ' Viewers should realize 'this has been algorithm-processed,' 'this has been visualization-designed,' rather than mistakenly believing 'this is real family relationships.

When family genealogy is digitized, algorithm-processed, a series of new questions emerge: 1) Privacy issues—do family members consent to their information being digitized. Publicly displayed. Under privacy regulations like GDPR, even deceased relatives' information is protected. 2) Data ownership—who owns this family data. Family collectively. Or compiler individually. If platform fails, how is data preserved. 3) Algorithmic bias—when algorithms process genealogical data, will they reinforce certain biases. For instance, automatically highlighting 'prominent' ancestors while ignoring ordinary people. Highlighting male lineage while marginalizing females. 4) 'Digital immortality' illusion—digitized genealogy creates an illusion of 'permanent preservation,' but digital data is actually very fragile (format obsolescence, platform closure, hardware damage).
