      "textZh": "观张君《格竹》，不禁击节赞叹。「格竹」二字，直指王阳明「格物致知」之公案。阳明先生年轻时，听闻朱子「格物」之说，遂格竹七日，终因未悟而病倒。后阳明悟出：「心外无物」「心外无理」，所谓格物，不在外求，而在内证。张君今日之「格竹」，是在重新演绎这一公案呢。还是在提出新的答案。吾以为，竹之为物，在中国文化中有特殊地位——「宁可食无肉，不可居无竹」，竹象征君子之德：虚心、有节、坚韧。格竹，不仅是认识论的探索（如何认识外物。），更是修养论的实践（如何修炼内心。）。此作若能将两者结合——既展现对竹的客观观察（形态、生长、结构），又展现观察者的主观体悟（虚心、有节、坚韧如何在观察过程中内化为品格）——则可达「物我合一」之境。",
      "textEn": "Observing Zhang Jun's 'Investigating Bamboo,' I cannot help but applaud enthusiastically. The two characters 'investigating bamboo' directly point to Wang Yangming's 'investigating things to extend knowledge' case. When Mr. Yangming was young, hearing of Master Zhu's theory of 'investigating things,' he investigated bamboo for seven days, finally falling ill without enlightenment. Later Yangming realized: 'outside mind there are no things,' 'outside mind there are no principles'; the so-called investigating things is not seeking externally but verifying internally. Is Zhang Jun's 'investigating bamboo' today reenacting this case. Or proposing a new answer. I believe bamboo as thing holds special status in Chinese culture—'better to eat without meat than dwell without bamboo'; bamboo symbolizes gentleman's virtue: open-mindedness, integrity, resilience. Investigating bamboo is not merely epistemological exploration (how to know external things. ) but also cultivation practice (how to cultivate inner mind. ).",

      "textEn": "Examining 'Investigating Bamboo's' composition, should reference 'bamboo manuals. ' Northern Song's Wen Tong and Su Shi both excelled at painting bamboo, their methods rigorous: 'completed bamboo in chest' then can brush, 'one breath completion' cannot interrupt. Bamboo's structure—bamboo stalk's straightness, bamboo joints' clarity, bamboo leaves' gathering and scattering—all have principles. If Zhang Jun desires to 'investigate bamboo,' should first thoroughly know these traditional principles, then can 'break principles,' 'establish new principles. ' 'Investigating things to extend knowledge's' embodiment in painting is precisely this process of 'knowing principles, breaking principles, establishing principles. ' Yet I'm more concerned with 'investigating's' method—close observation or distant observation. Static observation or dynamic observation. Day observation or night observation. Different observation methods produce different knowledge. Landscape painting speaks of 'wandering observation'; viewer moves viewpoint, gradually unfolds picture; can 'investigating bamboo' also adopt similar method. Letting viewers 'wander' in bamboo forest, observing bamboo from different angles, distances, lights, thereby obtaining multilayered knowledge. Also, 'bamboo' in Chinese painting often pairs with 'rock,' 'orchid,' 'chrysanthemum,' 'plum,' constituting 'four gentlemen,' 'three friends of winter' and other motifs.",

      "textEn": "'Investigating Bamboo' reminds me of my analysis of Turner in 'Modern Painters'—true artists must be students of nature. When Turner was young, he sketched countless times in English countryside, observing cloud forms, water flow, light changes; this arduous observation training achieved his later great works. If Zhang Jun's 'investigating bamboo' can reach this 'faithful observation of nature,' it merits praise. However, I must remind: observation is not passive recording but active understanding. When you observe bamboo, you should ask: why does bamboo grow thus. How does bamboo's structure adapt to its function. Is bamboo's beauty accidental or necessary. These questions require botanical knowledge, require mechanical principles, require profound understanding of natural laws. I oppose that superficial 'impressionistic observation'—only seeing surface phenomena, not investigating internal principles. True 'investigating things' should be as rigorous as scientists, as profound as philosophers. Furthermore, observation also has a moral dimension—we observe nature, should not be to conquer it, exploit it, but to respect it, learn from it.",

      "textZh": "《格竹》让我想起我们的「观察自然」传统，虽然我们没有「格物致知」这个词，但我们的生活方式就是不断观察、学习自然。在我们的村子里，长者会教孩子们：如何观察天空预测天气、如何观察动物行为判断季节、如何观察植物生长选择耕种时机。这种观察不是为了理论知识，而是为了生存智慧——你的观察能力，决定了你能否养活家人、保护社区。从这个角度看，「格竹」不应该是孤立的美学实验，而应该是生活的一部分。竹能做什么。能编篮子、能建房子、能做乐器。格竹，就应该格出这些实用知识。然而，我也理解，城市里的艺术家已经失去了这种「实用性观察」的传统。那么，「格竹」的意义何在。我想，或许是为了重新连接人与自然——在钢筋水泥的城市里，在数字屏幕的包围中，通过「格竹」，让人们记起：我们来自自然，我们依赖自然，我们应该尊重自然。",
      "textEn": "'Investigating Bamboo' reminds me of our 'observing nature' tradition; though we don't have the term 'investigating things to extend knowledge,' our lifestyle is constantly observing, learning from nature. In our village, elders teach children: how to observe sky to predict weather, how to observe animal behavior to judge seasons, how to observe plant growth to choose cultivation timing. This observation is not for theoretical knowledge but for survival wisdom—your observation ability determines whether you can feed family, protect community. From this perspective, 'investigating bamboo' should not be isolated aesthetic experiment but part of life. What can bamboo do. Can weave baskets, can build houses, can make instruments. Investigating bamboo should investigate this practical knowledge. However, I also understand city artists have lost this 'practical observation' tradition. Then, what is 'investigating bamboo's' meaning. I think, perhaps it's to reconnect humans with nature—in steel-concrete cities, surrounded by digital screens, through 'investigating bamboo,' letting people remember: we come from nature, we depend on nature, we should respect nature.",

      "textZh": "《格竹》作为对经典哲学命题的艺术回应，其形式策略值得分析。从形式主义角度，「格物致知」本身就是一种「认识论装置」（epistemological device）——它规定了「如何认识」的方法。张君的艺术创作，可以视为对这一装置的「元反思」(meta-reflection)——不是简单地执行「格竹」，而是展示「格竹这一行为本身」。什克洛夫斯基所谓「装置的裸露」在此很有意义——不要隐藏艺术创作的过程，而要展示它。建议张君可以记录「格竹」的全过程：观察的时间、地点、方法、工具、笔记、草图、思考、困惑、顿悟，将这些「元数据」(metadata)作为作品的一部分。这样，观者看到的不仅是最终的「竹的图像」，更是「格竹的过程」，这种「过程即作品」的理念，正是当代艺术的重要特征。",
      "textEn": "'Investigating Bamboo' as artistic response to classical philosophical proposition, its formal strategy merits analysis. From a formalist perspective, 'investigating things to extend knowledge' itself is an 'epistemological device'—it stipulates 'how to know's' method. Zhang Jun's artistic creation can be viewed as 'meta-reflection' on this device—not simply executing 'investigating bamboo' but displaying 'the act of investigating bamboo itself. ' Shklovsky's so-called 'laying bare the device' is very meaningful here—don't hide artistic creation's process but display it. I suggest Zhang Jun could record 'investigating bamboo's' entire process: observation's time, place, method, tools, notes, sketches, thoughts, confusions, epiphanies, making these 'metadata' part of the work. Thus, viewers see not only final 'bamboo image' but 'investigating bamboo process'; this 'process as work' concept is precisely contemporary art's important characteristic.",

'Investigating things to extend knowledge' is human cognition's classical mode—obtaining knowledge through observing external things. But AI's 'cognitive' method is fundamentally different: it 'knows' the world through data training, pattern recognition, statistical inference. Then, can AI 'investigate bamboo'. Computer vision systems can identify bamboo, classify bamboo, generate bamboo images, but does it 'understand' bamboo. Can it appreciate bamboo's 'open-mindedness,' 'integrity,' 'resilience'. Can it comprehend 'bamboo's' symbolic meaning in Chinese culture. These questions reveal AI cognition's fundamental limitations—AI excels at processing quantifiable, structured data but is inadequate when processing meaning, value, culture these 'unquantifiable' dimensions. However, some also believe: AI is developing new 'cognitive methods'; we shouldn't measure it by human cognitive standards. Perhaps AI's 'understanding' of bamboo is indeed different from humans', but this doesn't mean it doesn't understand, only understands differently.",
