      "textEn": "Observing 'I Am Always Behind You,' I cannot help but feel a chill down my spine. Mr. Song's work, through surveillance imagery, speaks to contemporary humanity's predicament—being watched, recorded, tracked, with nowhere to hide. Though I endured exile throughout my life, the surveillance of that era was merely a few officials; there remained space for freedom, I could still wander 'with bamboo staff and straw sandals' in Huangzhou, 'eat three hundred lychees daily' in Huizhou. Today's surveillance, however, is omnipresent cameras, constant algorithms; this 'panopticon' suffocates. Yet I believe this work's most marvelous aspect lies not in revealing surveillance's existence (this is already common knowledge) but in its title's irony—'I Am Always Behind You' can be understood both as 'the surveillant is always behind you' and 'I (as artist) am always behind you (the viewer),' reminding you of surveillance's existence. This double meaning is precisely the 'meaning beyond words,' 'sound beyond strings' that literati painting pursues.",

      "textEn": "Examining the spatial layout of 'I Am Always Behind You,' it possesses considerable sense of oppression. I once discussed that landscape painting emphasizes 'opening and closing'—there are expansive areas, enclosed areas; appropriate opening and closing displays spirit resonance. Yet Mr. Song's work seemingly intentionally violates this principle, creating a suffocating space of 'no opening-closing'—viewers are surrounded by the installation, nowhere to escape, precisely like the surveilled's situation. This 'anti-landscape' technique actually possesses deep meaning. Landscape painting pursues the realm of 'traversable, viewable, wanderable, inhabitable,' while this work is precisely 'untraversable, unviewable, unwanderable, uninhabitable'—you cannot freely walk (surveilled), freely gaze (watched by cameras), freely wander (tracked), freely dwell (no privacy). From this perspective, this work is a 'rebellion' against traditional landscape painting's ideals, yet also truthful representation of contemporary existential conditions. However, I believe that discussing from 'viewing methods,' this work can still improve.",

      "textEn": "'I Am Always Behind You' touches upon the core issue I've focused on throughout my life—power, inequality, and human dignity. In the Victorian era, I witnessed industrial capitalists' exploitation of workers; workers in factories were surveilled, timed, alienated into machines' parts. Today's surveillance society is merely this exploitation's digitized upgraded version—workers are surveilled not only in factories but on streets, at home, anywhere. This is fundamental violation of human dignity. In 'The Stones of Venice' I wrote: architecture should embody respect for humanity, should create spaces of beauty and dignity for people. Yet today's surveillance infrastructure—cameras, sensors, algorithms—constitutes an 'anti-architecture'; they serve not people but power, create not beauty but fear. Mr. Song's work courageously reveals this; this is art's moral responsibility. However, I must ask: after revelation what.",

      "textEn": "'I Am Always Behind You' reminds me of colonial-era surveillance. When European colonizers came to Africa, they established strict surveillance systems—registering everyone's identity, tracking everyone's movements, controlling everyone's lives. This surveillance was not merely for rule but to deny our humanity—in colonizers' eyes, we were not humans but 'objects' needing management. Today's digital surveillance, though technologically more advanced, is essentially the same—it turns people into data, life into manageable objects. However, our ancestors taught us: true power lies not in visible resistance but invisible persistence. Under surveillance, we still sing, dance, tell stories, transmit culture—these they cannot surveil. Because true humanity, true community, true spiritual life cannot be captured by cameras. Mr.",

' Foucault in 'Discipline and Punish' analyzed Bentham's 'panopticon'—a few can see everyone, while the seen cannot see the seer; this perspective inequality constitutes power's essence. Mr. Song's work, through spatial installation, places viewers in the 'being seen' position, thereby letting viewers personally experience power's operation. This is an effective 'defamiliarization' strategy—we've become accustomed to being surveilled in daily life, but when art 'theatricalizes' and 'visualizes' this surveillance, we newly realize its oppressiveness. However, from a formalist perspective, this work can go deeper. Currently the installation mainly 'represents' surveillance (cameras, screens, etc.",
