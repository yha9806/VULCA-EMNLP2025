        textZh: `"精美对话：花萼、花瓣、刺"——这个标题用植物的不同部分作为隐喻，让我想起中国绘画中的"四君子"（梅兰竹菊）传统。我们不是单纯描绘植物，而是借植物言志。梅花代表坚韧，兰花代表幽雅，竹子代表气节。同样，这件作品中的"花萼、花瓣、刺"不只是形态，更是艺术创作的不同面向——花萼是保护与孕育，花瓣是绽放与美丽，刺是防御与危险。这种植物隐喻提醒我们：艺术从来不是单一的美，而是复杂生命力的展现。`,
        textEn: `"Exquisite Dialogue: Sepals, Petals, Thorns"—this title uses plant parts as metaphor, reminding me of Chinese painting's "Four Gentlemen" (plum, orchid, bamboo, chrysanthemum) tradition. We don't merely depict plants, but express aspirations through plants. Plum represents resilience, orchid elegance, bamboo integrity. Similarly, "sepals, petals, thorns" in this work are not just forms, but different facets of artistic creation—sepals are protection and gestation, petals are blooming and beauty, thorns are defense and danger. This botanical metaphor reminds us: art has never been singular beauty, but manifestation of complex vitality.`,

        textEn: `Master Guo's "complex vitality" reminds me of grandmother's medicinal garden. Every plant she grew had multiple functions—same plant, roots can cure illness, leaves can be eaten, flowers can dye, thorns can protect. Grandmother said: "Plants teach us beauty is never isolated. Beauty is always connected to utility, danger, survival." This work is the same—art is not only "petals" (beautiful presentation), but also "sepals" (supporting structure) and "thorns" (critical edge). Perhaps complete art should be like complete plants—having attractive beauty, protective weapons, and capacity to nourish others.`,

But few idle people like us two." Meaning, beauty is everywhere; the key is whether we have eyes to discover it. Similarly, "sepals, petals, thorns" always coexist, but we often only see petals' beauty, overlooking sepals' support and thorns' protection. This work forces us to see the complete picture—creation is not only beauty's production, but also structure's establishment (sepals) and critical stance (thorns). This completeness is truly "exquisite dialogue."`,

        textEn: `The juxtaposition of "petals" and "thorns" reminds me of art history's recurring theme: creation necessarily accompanies destruction. Picasso said "every painting is a murder of its predecessor"; Rauschenberg erased de Kooning's drawing; Dadaists dismantled traditional aesthetics. Creation is not only addition but deletion; not only construction but deconstruction. Chung's work cleverly expresses this tension through botanical metaphor—petals' beauty depends on thorns' protection, while thorns' existence also reminds us: beauty is fragile, needs defending. This dialectical relationship is key to understanding art.`,

        textEn: `Professor Petrova's point makes me reflect. I've always emphasized "constructive" creation—craftsmen building beauty through hands. But perhaps I overlooked that destruction is also part of creation. Building Gothic cathedrals required demolishing old buildings; Renaissance breakthroughs needed questioning medieval traditions. Yet I still worry: does contemporary art overemphasize destructiveness? When "thorns" overwhelm "petals," do we lose art's healing power? This work's wisdom lies in maintaining balance—having thorns' sharpness and petals' tenderness. This balance may be what our era most needs.`,

        textEn: `Mr. Ruskin's "balance" question is crucial. In AI ethics, we face similar trade-offs: technological innovation necessarily disrupts existing order (destruction), but without new ethical frameworks protecting human values (sepals, petals), destruction becomes uncontrolled. Chung's work provides a model: the three (sepals, petals, thorns) are a whole—thorns are not for destruction's sake, but to protect petals; sepals are not rigid structure, but framework supporting growth. Similarly, art's critical edge (thorns) should defend beauty and meaning (petals), not nihilistic destruction. This is "exquisite dialogue's" meaning—parts coexist in dialogue.`,

        textEn: `"Thorns" make me think of a profound question: Why do beautiful things need protection? Roses have thorns, cacti have thorns, artists have boundaries. We often say "art is fragile," but perhaps more accurately, art is "defensively fragile." It acknowledges its fragility (petals easily broken), but simultaneously establishes defense (thorns' existence). This reminds me of women in our community—they gently nurture children (petals), but when facing injustice, resolutely resist (thorns). Vulnerability is not weakness, but honesty; defense is not attack, but self-protection. This dialectic is vividly embodied in art.`,

        textEn: `Mama Zola's "defensively fragile" is an exquisite concept. This reminds me of bamboo—outwardly flexible, inwardly resilient; seemingly fragile, actually strong. Bamboo resists storms not through rigidity, but by bending to dissolve force. This is wisdom of "combining softness and strength." Similarly, art's defense should not be closure and rejection, but flexibility and responsiveness. "Thorns" are not to harm viewers, but to maintain necessary distance—making viewers respect the work, not casually consume it. This defense is actually boundary consciousness, foundation of healthy relationships.`,

        textEn: `Your dialogue brings to mind an important issue in feminist art: how to maintain strength while expressing vulnerability. For long, women's vulnerability was seen as weakness, while male defensiveness was seen as strength. But Chung's work offers a perspective beyond gender binaries—vulnerability and defense are not opposed, but symbiotic. Petals' beauty needs thorns' protection; thorns' meaning comes from guarding petals. This interdependence breaks the simple "strong/weak" opposition, proposing a more complex, more authentic model of strength. Perhaps true strength is not rejecting vulnerability, but establishing defense within vulnerability.`,

Perhaps "exquisite" is not flawless beauty, but beauty that has undergone dialogue, critique, defense. This beauty doesn't passively await appreciation, but actively dialogues with the world.

If AI can mass-produce "beautiful" images, but these beauties lack critical edge (no thorns), lack structure (no sepals), they're dangerous—they'd immerse us in superficial pleasantness, losing capacity for deep thinking. Chung's work, through the complete structure of "sepals, petals, thorns," reminds us: responsible aesthetics must include three dimensions—structural thinking (sepals), sensory presentation (petals), critical reflection (thorns). All indispensable.`,
