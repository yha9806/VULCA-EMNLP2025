I once said 'poetry and painting fundamentally follow the same principles'; now observing two people's same-titled works, one precisely sees the wonder of 'same subject matter yet each has different spirit resonance. ' The two characters 'Origin Wandering,' in Chen Jun's brush, seem to emphasize more the tension between 'displacement' and 'belonging. ' Human life like duckweed, drifting with water, where is home. Where are roots. This question is especially acute in contemporary times—in the globalization era, people migrate for study, for work, for refuge; identity becomes complex and fluid. Though I was born in Northern Song, my whole life drifted, from capital to Huangzhou, Huizhou, Danzhou; at each place, I needed to redefine 'where is my home. ' Yet my response is: 'where this heart is at peace is my home'—home is not outside but inside; roots are not in land but in heart. If Chen Jun could embody this 'internal sense of belonging' in the work, it would transcend geographic-level root-seeking, ascending to spiritual-level self-affirmation.

Yet discussing through landscape painting methods, 'mixing' also needs principles. Though Chinese painting has the saying 'ink divides into five colors' (scorched, concentrated, heavy, light, clear), transitions between these five colors need to be natural, coordinated, not abrupt. Today's mixed media, if various materials and techniques are chaotically mixed, is like 'five colors cause blindness'; instead losing aesthetic appeal. I suggest Chen Jun could learn the method of 'clear primary-secondary'—determining one main medium or technique as 'skeleton,' other media as 'auxiliary,' like the relationship between 'main peak' and 'auxiliary peaks' in landscape painting. The subject matter of 'displacement' and 'belonging' can also be embodied in spatial composition. 'Displacement' can be expressed with 'scattered perspective'—multiple viewpoints, multiple spaces juxtaposed, expressing fluidity; 'belonging' can be expressed with 'central composition'—having one visual center, symbolizing spiritual destination. Their contrast and tension can constitute the work's 'visual drama.",timestamp:6646,replyTo:"su-shi",interactionType:"agree-extend",quotedText:"观陈君《源游》，与叶君同题而各有千秋",references:[{critic:"guo-xi",source:"landscape-theory.md",quote:"君子之所以爱夫山水者，其旨安在？",page:"Section 4: Quote 10"},{critic:"guo-xi",source:"key-concepts.md",quote:"气韵生动 (Spirit Resonance)",page:"Core Concept #3"}]},{id:"msg-artwork-10-3",personaId:"john-ruskin",textZh:"陈君的《源游》让我思考「归属」的道德维度。在《直至最后》中，我批判资本主义对人的异化——工人被剥夺了劳动的尊严、社区的归属、土地的根基。今日的全球化加剧了这种异化——人们为了经济机会而迁移，但这种迁移常常是被迫的、无奈的，而非自由的、自愿的。因此，谈论「位移」时，我们必须区分：这是特权者的位移（留学、旅行、事业发展），还是弱者的位移（难民、劳工、流亡）。前者可以浪漫化为「寻根之旅」，后者则是生存的挣扎。陈君作为艺术家，有责任澄清：你所探讨的位移是哪一种。你的归属焦虑是来自特权还是压迫。如果是前者，那么你的作品可能是自我中心的精英焦虑；如果是后者，那么你的作品有潜力成为对不平等的批判。我一生倡导：艺术必须服务于社会正义。",textEn:"Chen Jun's 'Origin Wandering' makes me contemplate 'belonging's' moral dimension. In 'Unto This Last,' I critiqued capitalism's alienation of humanity—workers deprived of labor's dignity, community's belonging, land's foundation. Today's globalization intensifies this alienation—people migrate for economic opportunities, but this migration is often forced, helpless, not free, voluntary. Therefore, when discussing 'displacement,' we must distinguish: is this privileged displacement (study abroad, travel, career development) or vulnerable displacement (refugees, laborers, exile). The former can be romanticized as 'root-seeking journey,' the latter is survival's struggle. As an artist, Chen Jun has responsibility to clarify: which kind of displacement are you exploring. Does your belonging anxiety come from privilege or oppression. If the former, then your work may be self-centered elite anxiety; if the latter, then your work has potential to become critique of inequality.

In African history, diaspora was not personal choice but cruel consequence of colonialism and slave trade. Millions of Africans were forcibly taken from ancestral lands, scattered across Americas, Caribbean, Europe. Their belonging question is not philosophical but existential—who am I. Where do I belong. Is my culture still there. However, diaspora also created new possibilities—African Americans, African Caribbeans, African Europeans developed new cultural forms (jazz, reggae, hip-hop); these cultures both retained African roots and incorporated new elements. This is what we call 'creolization'—not simple assimilation, nor clinging to tradition, but creative fusion.
