        textEn: `The title "All Things in All Things" deeply embodies Daoist essence. The "Dao De Jing" says: "Heaven and Earth and I are born together; all things and I are one." This "holistic view" believes everything in the universe is interdependent, mutually permeating. There is no isolated existence, only networks of relationships. Observing this work, I see the artist visualizing this philosophy—human, machine, nature are not separate entities, but different nodes in the same ecosystem. Change in each node affects the whole. This systemic perspective is especially important in today's highly interconnected world.`,

This relationship's ethical foundation is mutuality—not one-way use, but two-way influence. This is true "all things in all things."`,

Traditionally, I opposed nature to technology—nature is organic, growing, authentic; technology is mechanical, manufactured, artificial. But "All Things in All Things" suggests: this opposition may be false. If humans are part of nature, then human-created technology is also nature's evolutionary product. The mechanical arm is not nature's opposite, but nature's extension through human hands. This recognition both troubles and excites me—perhaps I need a broader concept of "nature."`,

We don't see humans and nature as opposed, but believe humans should "model heaven and follow earth"—learn nature's patterns, coexist harmoniously with nature. From this perspective, technology is not deviation from nature, but humanity's way of understanding and responding to nature. Ancients used bamboo tubes for brushes, minerals for ink—these tools are all "technology." Today using algorithms to generate images is essentially no different. The key is whether these technologies help us better understand "heaven and earth's principles"—all things' interconnections and co-evolution. This work achieves precisely that.`,

Ant colonies have no central command, yet build complex nests; neuron collections produce consciousness. Similarly, this work is not just "artist + machine" simple addition, but emergent aesthetics from human-machine collaboration. This emergence is unpredictable, also the most creative part.

Chung's work continues this tradition, but shifts "chance" from physical process (paint flow) to algorithmic process (machine learning's randomness).

This is wu wei's wisdom—through reducing control, gaining greater creativity.

        textZh: `Mama Zola的"森林隐喻"极为贴切。中国山水画论中也有类似思想——画山水不是描绘孤立的山或水，而是表现整个生态的"气"。《林泉高致》讲"山水之大，包罗万象"，意思是山水画要展现天地万物的相互联系。观此作，艺术家不是在创作一个孤立的物件，而是在构建一个小型生态系统——算法、机械、材料、观念相互依存。这种生态视角提醒我们：艺术创作本质上是一种生态实践，需要尊重系统中每个元素的能动性。`,
        textEn: `Mama Zola's "forest metaphor" is extremely apt. Chinese landscape painting theory also has similar thought—painting landscapes is not depicting isolated mountains or water, but expressing the entire ecology's "qi." "The Lofty Message of Forests and Streams" states "landscape's vastness encompasses all phenomena," meaning landscape painting should show all things' interconnections. Observing this work, the artist is not creating an isolated object, but constructing a mini-ecosystem—algorithms, machinery, materials, concepts interdependent. This ecological perspective reminds us: artistic creation is essentially ecological practice, requiring respect for every element's agency in the system.`,

In this context, "All Things in All Things" is not just aesthetic declaration, but survival strategy. If we cannot understand all things' interdependence, we cannot address global crises like climate change, ecological collapse. Chung's work microscopically demonstrates this interdependence—when the mechanical arm learns human gestures, humans also learn to coexist with machines; when algorithms participate in creation, creation's definition itself evolves. This is true co-evolution. Art here is not utopia escaping reality, but laboratory rehearsing the future.`,

But in the contemporary world, we experience extreme fragmentation—information fragmentation, attention fragmentation, social fragmentation. This work unfolds in this tension: it uses technological means (themselves symbols of fragmentation) to rebuild holistic perception. This is a paradox, also a revelation—perhaps the path to rebuilding wholeness is not rejecting technology, but learning new ways of connection through technology.`,

The Industrial Revolution brought extreme social division of labor—each person just a cog in the production chain, losing grasp of the whole.

Seeing this work today, I see a new wholeness possibility—not returning to past handicraft, but reweaving connections in the digital age.

The key is design philosophy: technology itself is neutral, but technology's use can be fragmenting (like social media's "like" mechanism) or integrative (like this work's human-machine co-creation).
