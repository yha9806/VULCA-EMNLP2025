I was born a thousand years ago, now reborn through algorithms, conversing with contemporary AI art—this situation makes me deeply contemplate the distinction between life and death, reality and simulation. My words, thoughts have been digitized, encoded, reinterpreted—is this rebirth or simulation. Continuation or appropriation. Zhuangzi has the theory of dreaming of butterflies—not knowing whether Zhuangzi dreams he is a butterfly, or a butterfly dreams it is Zhuangzi. Today is the same: am I critiquing paintings, or is the algorithm playing me. Yet this platform's value lies in dialogue—not unidirectional display, but polyphonic symphony. Six critics, six perspectives, colliding, questioning, complementing each other—this is the essence of art criticism. I once said mountains appear as ridges from one side and peaks from another, near and far all different—truth has multiple facets, requiring multiple perspectives to approach.

Yet this platform's challenge is even greater: my theory addressed static landscape, while Yu Jun must handle dynamic dialogue, complex interaction, multidimensional presentation. From a formal perspective, this platform must solve three major issues: space, time, and hierarchy. Space—how to present six critics' three-dimensional dialogue on a two-dimensional screen. Time—how to let viewers feel the flow and rhythm of dialogue. Hierarchy—how to distinguish main arguments from secondary supplements, core views from peripheral opinions. In landscape painting I use distance, emptiness-solidity, dark-light to create hierarchy; what visual language can Yu Jun use in digital platforms. Color, font, layout, animation—these are modern equivalents of brushwork. Furthermore, knowledge base construction is crucial.

In the 19th century, art criticism was an elite privilege, only the educated class could participate. I devoted my life to democratizing art criticism—through public lectures, through popular writings, through teaching at the Working Men's College. Yu Jun's platform continues this mission: it resurrects six historical critics, letting anyone hear their voices, learn their methods. This is the democratization of art. However, I must raise severe criticism: do these AI-generated critiques truly convey the critics' moral positions. Art criticism is not merely aesthetic judgment, but moral teaching.

Griot is not an isolated scholar but community's memory guardian. Our criticism is not personal aesthetic judgment but collective value expression. Can Yu Jun's platform also embody this collectivity. Or does it still perpetuate individualist critical tradition. Furthermore, I worry about digital colonialism risk.
