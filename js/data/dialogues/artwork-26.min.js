Yet what use is justification. Before power, justification often proves powerless. This work explores "language, legitimation, and the need for self-explanation," touching upon the core issue of the relationship between human dignity and power. Why must we justify ourselves. Because someone accuses. Why does someone accuse. Because power seeks to judge. A letter of explanation is not merely a linguistic act, but a manifestation of power structures—who has the qualification to demand justification. Who holds the power to accept or reject justification. Who defines what constitutes "guilt" and what constitutes "defense". Zhuangzi taught that "argument has no victor"—the more we argue, the deeper we fall into language\'s trap, while truth retreats further away.

Is not landscape painting itself a form of "explanation". The ancients spoke of "painting as a vehicle for the Way" (hua yi zai dao)—painters express their worldview, values, and life attitudes through brush and ink, which constitutes a form of "self-explanation. " However, the brilliance of landscape painting lies in being "self-evident without words"—not through textual justification, but through visual presentation that allows viewers to perceive meaning themselves. Wu Jun\'s "Letter of Explanation" functions both as content (a text of justification) and as form (text as visual element). I suggest focusing on the "visuality" of the text—choices of typeface, layout methods, and writing medium all influence the effectiveness of the "explanation. " Is it neat printed type or handwritten cursive script. Formal document format or casual graffiti. These formal choices convey different attitudes—respectful submission, angry protest, or satirical mockery. Chinese calligraphy emphasizes "writing reveals character" (zi ru qi ren)—Yan Zhenqing\'s "Requiem for My Nephew" moves us not merely through textual content, but through the visual presentation of grief and indignation expressed in trembling brushstrokes.',timestamp:5957,replyTo:"su-shi",interactionType:"question-challenge",quotedText:"此作探讨「语言、正当化与自我解释的需要」，触及了人之尊严与权力之关系的核心问题",references:[{critic:"guo-xi",source:"landscape-theory.md",quote:"君子之所以爱夫山水者，其旨安在？",page:"Section 4: Quote 10"},{critic:"guo-xi",source:"key-concepts.md",quote:"气韵生动 (Spirit Resonance)",page:"Core Concept #3"}]},{id:"msg-artwork-26-3",personaId:"john-ruskin",textZh:"《辩白书》触及了我终生关注的主题——艺术家与社会的关系，以及艺术的道德责任。我曾为透纳的「模糊」绘画辩护，曾为前拉斐尔派的「真实」美学辩护，曾为哥特式建筑的「诚实」工艺辩护。每一次辩护，都是对当时主流品味和权力结构的挑战。辩白书是弱者的武器——当没有权力时，只能用语言为自己辩护。然而，吴君必须明白：辩白往往是无效的。不是因为辩白的理由不够充分，而是因为聆听者并不真正想理解。权力不需要理解，它只需要服从。我在19世纪为工人阶级辩护、为环境保护辩护、为公正工资辩护，但工业资本主义依然碾压一切。因此，真正的问题不是「如何辩白」，而是「为何需要辩白」——为何正义需要解释自己，而不正义却可以肆无忌惮。你的作品若能揭示这个结构性的问题，将非常有力。",textEn:'"Letter of Explanation" touches upon a theme that has occupied my entire life—the relationship between artist and society, and art\'s moral responsibility. I have defended Turner\'s "indistinct" paintings, championed the Pre-Raphaelites\' "truthful" aesthetics, and argued for Gothic architecture\'s "honest" craftsmanship. Each defense was a challenge to the prevailing taste and power structures of its time. A letter of explanation is the weapon of the weak—when one lacks power, only words remain for self-defense. However, Wu must understand: explanations are often futile. Not because the reasoning is insufficient, but because listeners do not truly wish to understand. Power requires no understanding; it demands only obedience. In the 19th century, I defended the working class, environmental protection, and fair wages, yet industrial capitalism crushed everything in its path. Therefore, the real question is not "how to explain oneself," but "why explanation is necessary"—why must justice justify itself while injustice runs rampant.

The colonizers came to our lands, called us "savage," "primitive," "in need of civilization," and demanded we prove ourselves worthy of human dignity. What arrogance. In our traditions, there was no such culture of "being judged"—our disputes were resolved through community dialogue, our conflicts healed through restorative justice. No one needed to "justify" themselves to external authorities, because the community itself was the highest arbiter. Yet colonialism shattered all this—introducing foreign laws, foreign languages, foreign standards, transforming us into defendants forever needing to "explain ourselves.

The letter of explanation possesses a similar "dialogic" structure—it is not monologue, but one side of a dialogue, with the other being the accuser (present or absent). 吴振华\'s work can be analyzed on several levels: (1) **Speech act**—explanation is performative utterance; it is not merely statement, but action.
