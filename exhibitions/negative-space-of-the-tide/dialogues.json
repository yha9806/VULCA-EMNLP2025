          "textEn": "Observing this work, the mechanical arm's movement trajectory exhibits a unique sense of rhythm. The brushstrokes' progression—rising,承, turning, and closing—though controlled by programming, seem to contain a certain \"natural spirit.\" I have long maintained that \"brush and ink should follow the times,\" and today's times inherently include artificial intelligence and algorithms. Can this technological intervention give birth to a new aesthetic paradigm? The precision of machinery and the randomness of art form a wondrous dialogue in this work. Look at those flowing lines—they follow patterns, yet seem to possess natural wonder. This reminds me of what I wrote in \"Ode to the Red Cliff\": \"What passes is like this, yet has never really gone.\" Technology may be new, yet art's essence—expressing human nature—has never changed.",

From the perspective of composition, the arrangement of line density and the variations in ink tone all conform to principles.

Each movement of the mechanical arm undergoes training and adjustment—how is this different from a painter's painstaking refinement of brushwork skill?

This work is the same—the artist begins a gesture, the machine responds to this gesture, materials carry this dialogue, audience completes this interpretation. Every participant is part of the story. This relational creation is closer to art's essence than any isolated genius work—it is shared, flowing, alive.",
