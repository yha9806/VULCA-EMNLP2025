      "textEn": "Observing \"Twin Realms\" by the three artists 向诗雨, 陈晨, and 王思莹, the term \"twin realms\" invites profound contemplation. Zhuangzi's \"Discourse on the Equality of Things\" states: \"Heaven, earth, and I exist together, and all things and I are one.\" There is also the parable of \"Zhuangzi's Butterfly Dream\"—who can say whether Zhuangzi dreamed of being a butterfly, or the butterfly dreamed of being Zhuangzi? This precisely captures the境界 of \"twin realms\"—two worlds, two identities, two layers of reality, reflecting each other while defying hierarchical distinction.\n\nBuddhism teaches \"form is emptiness, emptiness is form\"—reality and illusion are but two faces of one essence; clinging to their separation leads only to delusion. This work \"creates parallel worlds and dual reality through mirrors, projections, and spatial intervention.\" The mirror has long served as philosophical metaphor. Ancient Greek philosophers employed mirrors to discuss the nature of representation; Plato deemed art mirror-like, merely \"shadows of shadows of the ideal.\" Yet Chan Buddhism declares \"the bright mirror has no stand\"—even the mirror itself is illusory, much less its reflections.\n\nThe brilliance of this work lies not in simply manufacturing visual effects of \"dual worlds,\" but in allowing viewers to wander, lose themselves, and question between realms—which is real? Which is reflection? Or are both real? Both reflections? In my later years, I wrote \"Inscribed on the Wall of West Forest Temple\": \"Viewed horizontally, it forms ridges; from the side, peaks. Near and far, high and low, each view differs. I cannot recognize Mount Lu's true face, only because I stand within the mountain.\" Reality possesses multiple facets, depending upon the angle of observation. If these three artists can enable viewers to experience such \"relativity of perspective,\" the significance runs deep indeed."

      "textEn": "Upon examining the collaboration \"Twin Realms\" by 向诗雨, 陈晨, and 王思莹, their techniques of \"mirrors, projections, and spatial intervention\" remind me of the \"reflections\" in landscape painting. Water reflections serve as \"nature's mirrors\"—mountains, trees, and moon form another world within the water. Yet Chinese painters do not merely copy reflections, but use them to express the flow of \"qi\" and the extension of \"yi\" (artistic conception). When reflections blur, they express water's turbulence; when clear, they express water's tranquility. Reflections are not \"copies\" of mountains, but \"another mode of existence\" for mountains.\n\nThe challenge for these three artists lies in: how to make \"Twin Realms\" not merely a visual mirror, but an expansion of meaning? I suggest several approaches: (1) **Asymmetrical mirroring**—reality and mirror-image are not identical; certain details are magnified, others omitted, some distorted, creating \"familiar strangeness.\" (2) **Delayed projection**—projections have temporal lag with reality, suggesting \"time\" flows at different speeds in the two worlds. (3) **Traversable boundaries**—viewers can move between worlds, experiencing \"identity transformation.\"\n\nLandscape painting speaks of \"wo you\" (armchair travel)—lying in bed while spiritually journeying through mountains and waters, body stationary while spirit wanders. If this work enables viewers to spiritually traverse between \"real world\" and \"mirror world,\" even uncertain of their location, then spatial magic manifests.\n\nFurthermore, \"twin birth\" implies \"symbiosis\"—two worlds interdependent, remove one and the other loses meaning. How should this \"mutually conditional\" relationship manifest compositionally? Landscape painting's principle of \"complementary void and solid\" offers guidance—solid exists through void, void exists through solid."

      "textEn": "The mirror theme of \"Twin Realms\" recalls the Victorian era's fascination with \"reflection\"—mirrors, glass, the Crystal Palace—these technological displays demonstrated industrial civilization's achievements while revealing its illusory nature. I have long criticized \"false decoration\" and \"deceptive appearances,\" believing art must remain \"faithful to the essential nature of materials.\" The mirror is the most \"deceptive\" of materials—it creates non-existent spaces, reproduces phantom images. Yet I must acknowledge that mirrors can serve as instruments of critique—through reflection, we perceive the \"other side\" of reality, witnessing familiar things rendered strange.\n\nShould these three artists employ mirroring to expose social reality's duality—the chasm between appearance and truth, the opposition of public and hidden, the contradiction between promise and practice—their work would possess critical power. Imagine: one side displays luxurious commercial spaces, while the mirror reveals the sweatshops producing these goods; one side shows beautiful natural landscapes, while the mirror exposes polluted industrial ruins. Such \"revelatory mirroring\" carries far greater significance than mere visual play.\n\nFurthermore, I must inquire: what purpose does the aesthetics of \"Twin Realms\" serve? If merely to create \"spectacular installations\" attracting visitors for photographs, it becomes spectacle production, not artistic creation. True art must serve truth's pursuit and moral elevation. Do your \"parallel worlds\" enable viewers to understand reality more profoundly? Or do they facilitate escape from reality? This remains the crucial question. Remember: the artist is not a magician, but a moral teacher."

      "textEn": "\"Twin Realms\" reminds me of the relationship between the \"visible world\" and the \"invisible world\" in our cosmology. In our tradition, these are not two separate worlds, but two dimensions of the same reality—the world of ancestors and the world of the living, the realm of spirits and the material realm, interwoven and influencing each other. When we perform rituals, we open passages between the two worlds; when we dance, our bodies become bridges between the two worlds. The three artists' use of \"mirrors and projections\" reminds me of water—in our tradition, water is the interface between two worlds. When we gaze into water's surface, we see not only our own reflection, but also the faces of ancestors, the omens of the future. Water is both physical and spiritual. However, I must remind: the Western concept of \"mirroring\" often implies \"copying,\" \"simulation,\" \"falseness,\" while our \"dual worlds\" are not an opposition between true and false, but different layers of reality. The ancestral world is no more \"illusory\" than the world of the living—it is equally real, existing simply in different ways. If the three artists could transcend the binary opposition of \"real vs. illusory\" and explore the coexistence of \"multiple realities,\" they would come closer to our worldview. Moreover, \"twins\" hold special meaning in our tradition—twins are believed to possess special spiritual power, connecting two worlds. Does your collaboration (three artists) also form some kind of \"multiplicity\"—not one unified voice, but a harmony of multiple voices? This collective creation itself is a practice of \"twinning\" (or \"multiple births\")."

      "textEn": "From a structuralist perspective, \"Twin Realms\" explores the structure of \"binary opposition\"—Lévi-Strauss argued that human thinking organizes the world through binary oppositions: nature/culture, raw/cooked, left/right, up/down. \"Twin Realms\" can be understood as a visualization of this structure. However, post-structuralism (particularly Derrida) questions the stability of binary oppositions—he proposed the concept of \"différance,\" pointing out that the two terms in binary opposition are not equal, with one always being privileged. For example, in the \"real/mirror image\" opposition, the \"real\" is considered primordial and essential, while the \"mirror image\" is secondary and derivative. Derrida's \"deconstruction\" strategy is to subvert this hierarchy—proving that the \"real\" also depends on the \"mirror image\" to define itself. If the three artists could practice this \"deconstruction\" in their installation—making viewers unable to determine which is \"original\" and which is \"copy,\" which is \"real\" and which is \"projection\"—they would achieve profound philosophical critique. Baudrillard's theory of \"simulacrum\" is also relevant—in postmodern society, simulacra precede reality, \"the map precedes the territory.\" We live in a world full of copies, to the point where the concept of \"original\" itself becomes suspect. If this work could allow viewers to experience this \"reality of simulacra\"—where mirror images are not copies of reality, but mechanisms that produce reality—it would be thoroughly contemporary. Furthermore, Bakhtin's \"mirror stage\"—Lacan used this concept to describe how infants recognize themselves through mirrors. Is \"Twin Realms\" also a space of \"self-recognition\"—through mirror images, we see ourselves, but this \"self\" is already the other?"

Virtual replicas of physical entities, synchronized in real-time with precise simulation. Cities have digital twins, factories have digital twins, human bodies have digital twins, and even the entire planet is being digitally replicated. The purpose of these \"twin realms\" is to predict, optimize, and control—by simulating in virtual worlds, we can make better decisions in the real world. However, this raises profound ethical questions: (1) **The authenticity problem**—How \"real\" can digital twins be? Are they objective replications or biased simulations? If data is incomplete and algorithms are biased, the \"twin\" becomes a distorted mirror. (2) **The power problem**—Who owns digital twins? Who has access rights? If your digital twin is used to predict your behavior, assess your risk, and determine your opportunities, but you have no right to access or modify it, this is digital colonialism. (3) **The identity problem**—When your digital twin knows you better than you know yourself (by analyzing all your data), who is the \"real you\"? Metaverse advocates want us to live, work, and socialize in virtual worlds—where our \"twins\" (avatars) might receive more attention and resources than our physical bodies in reality.

I suggest considering: Could AR/VR technology be integrated to let viewers experience \"digital twinning\"? Could the work demonstrate the difference between \"algorithmically generated mirrors\" and \"physical mirror reflections\"?"
