      "textZh": "观张君《格竹》，不禁击节赞叹！「格竹」二字，直指王阳明「格物致知」之公案。阳明先生年轻时，听闻朱子「格物」之说，遂格竹七日，终因未悟而病倒。后阳明悟出：「心外无物」「心外无理」，所谓格物，不在外求，而在内证。张君今日之「格竹」，是在重新演绎这一公案呢？还是在提出新的答案？吾以为，竹之为物，在中国文化中有特殊地位——「宁可食无肉，不可居无竹」，竹象征君子之德：虚心、有节、坚韧。格竹，不仅是认识论的探索（如何认识外物？），更是修养论的实践（如何修炼内心？）。此作若能将两者结合——既展现对竹的客观观察（形态、生长、结构），又展现观察者的主观体悟（虚心、有节、坚韧如何在观察过程中内化为品格）——则可达「物我合一」之境。中国画论讲「外师造化，中得心源」——向外师法自然，向内获得心灵的源泉。张君之「格竹」，当遵此道。建议在视觉呈现上，不仅画竹，更画「格竹者」——画人与竹的关系、人在竹前的姿态、人的视线与竹的生长方向的交汇，如此方能体现「格」之动态过程，而非静态结果。",
      "textEn": "Observing Zhang Jun's 'Investigating Bamboo,' I cannot help but applaud enthusiastically! The two characters 'investigating bamboo' directly point to Wang Yangming's 'investigating things to extend knowledge' case. When Mr. Yangming was young, hearing of Master Zhu's theory of 'investigating things,' he investigated bamboo for seven days, finally falling ill without enlightenment. Later Yangming realized: 'outside mind there are no things,' 'outside mind there are no principles'; the so-called investigating things is not seeking externally but verifying internally. Is Zhang Jun's 'investigating bamboo' today reenacting this case? Or proposing a new answer? I believe bamboo as thing holds special status in Chinese culture—'better to eat without meat than dwell without bamboo'; bamboo symbolizes gentleman's virtue: open-mindedness, integrity, resilience. Investigating bamboo is not merely epistemological exploration (how to know external things?) but also cultivation practice (how to cultivate inner mind?). If this work could combine both—displaying objective observation of bamboo (form, growth, structure) and displaying observer's subjective comprehension (how open-mindedness, integrity, resilience are internalized into character during observation process)—it could reach the realm of 'object and self united.' Chinese painting theory speaks of 'outwardly learning from nature's creativity, inwardly obtaining mind's source'—externally learning from nature, internally obtaining spiritual source. Zhang Jun's 'investigating bamboo' should follow this way. I suggest in visual presentation, not only paint bamboo but paint 'the investigator'—painting human-bamboo relationship, human posture before bamboo, intersection of human sight and bamboo's growth direction; thus can embody 'investigating's' dynamic process, not static result.",

      "textZh": "审《格竹》之构图，当以「竹谱」为参照。北宋文同、苏轼皆善画竹，其法度严谨：「成竹在胸」方可下笔，「一气呵成」不可间断。竹之结构——竹竿之直、竹节之分明、竹叶之聚散——皆有法则。张君若欲「格竹」，当先熟知这些传统法则，然后才能「破法」「立新法」。「格物致知」在绘画中的体现，即是这种「知其法、破其法、立其法」的过程。然吾更关注「格」之方法——是近观还是远观？是静观还是动观？是日观还是夜观？不同的观察方式，会产生不同的认识。山水画讲「游观」，观者移动视点，逐步展开画面；「格竹」是否也可采用类似方法？让观者「游」于竹林，从不同角度、不同距离、不同光线下观察竹，从而获得多层次的认识。又，「竹」在中国画中常与「石」「兰」「菊」「梅」搭配，构成「四君子」「岁寒三友」等母题。张君若能在「格竹」的同时，也格「竹与环境的关系」——竹如何与石共生？如何与风互动？如何与光影变化？——则认识更全面。记住：孤立的认识是片面的，关系中的认识才是完整的。",
      "textEn": "Examining 'Investigating Bamboo's' composition, should reference 'bamboo manuals.' Northern Song's Wen Tong and Su Shi both excelled at painting bamboo, their methods rigorous: 'completed bamboo in chest' then can brush, 'one breath completion' cannot interrupt. Bamboo's structure—bamboo stalk's straightness, bamboo joints' clarity, bamboo leaves' gathering and scattering—all have principles. If Zhang Jun desires to 'investigate bamboo,' should first thoroughly know these traditional principles, then can 'break principles,' 'establish new principles.' 'Investigating things to extend knowledge's' embodiment in painting is precisely this process of 'knowing principles, breaking principles, establishing principles.' Yet I'm more concerned with 'investigating's' method—close observation or distant observation? Static observation or dynamic observation? Day observation or night observation? Different observation methods produce different knowledge. Landscape painting speaks of 'wandering observation'; viewer moves viewpoint, gradually unfolds picture; can 'investigating bamboo' also adopt similar method? Letting viewers 'wander' in bamboo forest, observing bamboo from different angles, distances, lights, thereby obtaining multilayered knowledge. Also, 'bamboo' in Chinese painting often pairs with 'rock,' 'orchid,' 'chrysanthemum,' 'plum,' constituting 'four gentlemen,' 'three friends of winter' and other motifs. If Zhang Jun could while 'investigating bamboo,' also investigate 'bamboo-environment relationship'—how does bamboo coexist with rock? How does it interact with wind? How with light-shadow changes?—the knowledge would be more comprehensive. Remember: isolated knowledge is one-sided; knowledge within relationships is complete.",

      "textZh": "《格竹》让我想起我在《现代画家》中对透纳的分析——真正的艺术家必须是自然的学生。透纳年轻时在英国乡间写生无数，观察云的形态、水的流动、光的变化，这些艰苦的观察训练，成就了他后来的伟大作品。张君的「格竹」，若能达到这种「对自然的忠实观察」，则值得赞赏。然而，我必须提醒：观察不是被动的记录，而是主动的理解。当你观察竹时，你应该问：竹为何如此生长？竹的结构如何适应其功能？竹的美是偶然的还是必然的？这些问题，需要植物学知识、需要力学原理、需要对自然法则的深刻理解。我反对那种肤浅的「印象式观察」——只看表面现象，不究内在原理。真正的「格物」，应该像科学家一样严谨，像哲学家一样深刻。此外，观察还有道德维度——我们观察自然，不应该是为了征服它、利用它，而应该是为了尊重它、学习它。竹的虚心，可以教我们谦逊；竹的有节，可以教我们坚守；竹的坚韧，可以教我们毅力。这种「从自然中学习美德」，正是我一生倡导的艺术与道德的统一。张君若能在作品中体现这种道德学习，则超越了纯粹的美学探索，上升为人格修养的实践。",
      "textEn": "'Investigating Bamboo' reminds me of my analysis of Turner in 'Modern Painters'—true artists must be students of nature. When Turner was young, he sketched countless times in English countryside, observing cloud forms, water flow, light changes; this arduous observation training achieved his later great works. If Zhang Jun's 'investigating bamboo' can reach this 'faithful observation of nature,' it merits praise. However, I must remind: observation is not passive recording but active understanding. When you observe bamboo, you should ask: why does bamboo grow thus? How does bamboo's structure adapt to its function? Is bamboo's beauty accidental or necessary? These questions require botanical knowledge, require mechanical principles, require profound understanding of natural laws. I oppose that superficial 'impressionistic observation'—only seeing surface phenomena, not investigating internal principles. True 'investigating things' should be as rigorous as scientists, as profound as philosophers. Furthermore, observation also has a moral dimension—we observe nature, should not be to conquer it, exploit it, but to respect it, learn from it. Bamboo's open-mindedness can teach us humility; bamboo's integrity can teach us perseverance; bamboo's resilience can teach us fortitude. This 'learning virtue from nature' is precisely the unity of art and morality I've advocated throughout my life. If Zhang Jun could embody this moral learning in the work, it would transcend pure aesthetic exploration, ascending to character cultivation practice.",

      "textZh": "《格竹》让我想起我们的「观察自然」传统，虽然我们没有「格物致知」这个词，但我们的生活方式就是不断观察、学习自然。在我们的村子里，长者会教孩子们：如何观察天空预测天气、如何观察动物行为判断季节、如何观察植物生长选择耕种时机。这种观察不是为了理论知识，而是为了生存智慧——你的观察能力，决定了你能否养活家人、保护社区。从这个角度看，「格竹」不应该是孤立的美学实验，而应该是生活的一部分。竹能做什么？能编篮子、能建房子、能做乐器。格竹，就应该格出这些实用知识。然而，我也理解，城市里的艺术家已经失去了这种「实用性观察」的传统。那么，「格竹」的意义何在？我想，或许是为了重新连接人与自然——在钢筋水泥的城市里，在数字屏幕的包围中，通过「格竹」，让人们记起：我们来自自然，我们依赖自然，我们应该尊重自然。张君的作品若能成为一种「邀请」——邀请观者也去格物、去观察、去与自然建立关系——则比单纯的艺术展示更有价值。或许可以设计某种「参与式格竹」——给观者一株竹、一本笔记、一段时间，让他们自己去观察、去记录、去体会。这样，艺术就不再是被动欣赏的对象，而是主动参与的过程。",
      "textEn": "'Investigating Bamboo' reminds me of our 'observing nature' tradition; though we don't have the term 'investigating things to extend knowledge,' our lifestyle is constantly observing, learning from nature. In our village, elders teach children: how to observe sky to predict weather, how to observe animal behavior to judge seasons, how to observe plant growth to choose cultivation timing. This observation is not for theoretical knowledge but for survival wisdom—your observation ability determines whether you can feed family, protect community. From this perspective, 'investigating bamboo' should not be isolated aesthetic experiment but part of life. What can bamboo do? Can weave baskets, can build houses, can make instruments. Investigating bamboo should investigate this practical knowledge. However, I also understand city artists have lost this 'practical observation' tradition. Then, what is 'investigating bamboo's' meaning? I think, perhaps it's to reconnect humans with nature—in steel-concrete cities, surrounded by digital screens, through 'investigating bamboo,' letting people remember: we come from nature, we depend on nature, we should respect nature. If Zhang Jun's work could become an 'invitation'—inviting viewers to also investigate things, observe, establish relationship with nature—it would be more valuable than mere artistic display. Perhaps could design some 'participatory investigating bamboo'—giving viewers a bamboo plant, a notebook, a period of time, letting them observe, record, experience themselves. Thus, art is no longer passively appreciated object but actively participated process.",

      "textZh": "《格竹》作为对经典哲学命题的艺术回应，其形式策略值得分析。从形式主义角度，「格物致知」本身就是一种「认识论装置」（epistemological device）——它规定了「如何认识」的方法。张君的艺术创作，可以视为对这一装置的「元反思」(meta-reflection)——不是简单地执行「格竹」，而是展示「格竹这一行为本身」。什克洛夫斯基所谓「装置的裸露」在此很有意义——不要隐藏艺术创作的过程，而要展示它。建议张君可以记录「格竹」的全过程：观察的时间、地点、方法、工具、笔记、草图、思考、困惑、顿悟，将这些「元数据」(metadata)作为作品的一部分。这样，观者看到的不仅是最终的「竹的图像」，更是「格竹的过程」，这种「过程即作品」的理念，正是当代艺术的重要特征。巴赫金的「对话性」理论也可以引入——「格竹」可以成为多个声音的对话：王阳明的声音（心外无物）、朱熹的声音（格物穷理）、艺术家的声音（当代艺术实践）、观者的声音（各自的理解与诠释）。通过展示这些不同声音的「争鸣」，作品超越了单一视角，成为思想的「竞技场」(arena)。俄国形式主义强调文学的「自我指涉性」(self-referentiality)——文学谈论文学本身，而非外部现实。同理，「格竹」可以具有「自我指涉性」——不仅格竹，更格「格竹」这一行为，这种元层次的反思，将使作品更有哲学深度。",
      "textEn": "'Investigating Bamboo' as artistic response to classical philosophical proposition, its formal strategy merits analysis. From a formalist perspective, 'investigating things to extend knowledge' itself is an 'epistemological device'—it stipulates 'how to know's' method. Zhang Jun's artistic creation can be viewed as 'meta-reflection' on this device—not simply executing 'investigating bamboo' but displaying 'the act of investigating bamboo itself.' Shklovsky's so-called 'laying bare the device' is very meaningful here—don't hide artistic creation's process but display it. I suggest Zhang Jun could record 'investigating bamboo's' entire process: observation's time, place, method, tools, notes, sketches, thoughts, confusions, epiphanies, making these 'metadata' part of the work. Thus, viewers see not only final 'bamboo image' but 'investigating bamboo process'; this 'process as work' concept is precisely contemporary art's important characteristic. Bakhtin's 'dialogism' theory can also be introduced—'investigating bamboo' can become multiple voices' dialogue: Wang Yangming's voice (outside mind no things), Zhu Xi's voice (investigating things exhausting principles), artist's voice (contemporary art practice), viewer's voice (each's understanding and interpretation). Through displaying these different voices' 'contention,' the work transcends singular perspective, becoming thought's 'arena.' Russian Formalism emphasizes literature's 'self-referentiality'—literature discusses literature itself, not external reality. Similarly, 'investigating bamboo' can possess 'self-referentiality'—not only investigating bamboo but investigating 'investigating bamboo' this act; this meta-level reflection will make the work more philosophically profound.",

      "textZh": "《格竹》在AI时代提出了关于「机器认知」的深刻问题。「格物致知」是人类认知的经典模式——通过观察外物来获得知识。但AI的「认知」方式根本不同：它通过数据训练、模式识别、统计推理来「认识」世界。那么，AI能「格竹」吗？计算机视觉系统可以识别竹子、分类竹子、生成竹子的图像，但它「理解」竹吗？它能体会竹的「虚心」「有节」「坚韧」吗？它能领悟「竹」在中国文化中的象征意义吗？这些问题揭示了AI认知的根本局限——AI擅长处理可量化的、结构化的数据，但在处理意义、价值、文化这些「不可量化」的维度时，力不从心。然而，也有人认为：AI正在发展出新的「认知方式」，我们不应该用人类认知标准去衡量它。也许AI对竹的「理解」确实不同于人类，但这不意味着它不理解，只是理解方式不同。这引发了更深层的问题：「理解」的本质是什么？必须有「意识」才能理解吗？还是只要能做出正确反应就算理解？张君的作品若能探讨这些问题——例如对比「人类格竹」与「AI格竹」的过程与结果，揭示两种认知方式的异同——将为AI哲学提供重要的艺术视角。在AI越来越多地参与知识生产的时代，重新思考「何为认识」「何为理解」，具有重要的伦理与哲学意义。",
      "textEn": "'Investigating Bamboo' raises profound questions about 'machine cognition' in the AI era. 'Investigating things to extend knowledge' is human cognition's classical mode—obtaining knowledge through observing external things. But AI's 'cognitive' method is fundamentally different: it 'knows' the world through data training, pattern recognition, statistical inference. Then, can AI 'investigate bamboo'? Computer vision systems can identify bamboo, classify bamboo, generate bamboo images, but does it 'understand' bamboo? Can it appreciate bamboo's 'open-mindedness,' 'integrity,' 'resilience'? Can it comprehend 'bamboo's' symbolic meaning in Chinese culture? These questions reveal AI cognition's fundamental limitations—AI excels at processing quantifiable, structured data but is inadequate when processing meaning, value, culture these 'unquantifiable' dimensions. However, some also believe: AI is developing new 'cognitive methods'; we shouldn't measure it by human cognitive standards. Perhaps AI's 'understanding' of bamboo is indeed different from humans', but this doesn't mean it doesn't understand, only understands differently. This raises deeper questions: what is 'understanding's' essence? Must there be 'consciousness' to understand? Or as long as correct responses can be made, it counts as understanding? If Zhang Jun's work could explore these questions—for instance contrasting 'human investigating bamboo' and 'AI investigating bamboo's' process and results, revealing two cognitive methods' similarities and differences—it would provide important artistic perspective for AI philosophy. In an era when AI increasingly participates in knowledge production, rethinking 'what is knowing,' 'what is understanding' has important ethical and philosophical significance.",
