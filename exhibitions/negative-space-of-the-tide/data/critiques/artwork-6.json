      "textEn": "Observing 'Memory Tides - Horizon Series,' I cannot help but recall my own life of rivers and seas. Throughout my life, I have been repeatedly exiled, traveling from the capital to Huangzhou, Huizhou, and Danzhou, and at each place I faced a new horizon. This work depicts horizons through abstract brushwork, and horizons represent life's boundaries yet also infinite starting points. Artist Zhang uses 'tides' to metaphorize memory, profoundly grasping the principle of 'flowing water does not compete for precedence'—memory ebbs and flows like tides, sometimes clear, sometimes blurred; this is life's truth. Chinese painting theory often speaks of 'distant mountains without texture strokes'—the farther, the more blurred. This work possesses this resonance—at the horizon line, forms dissolve, like memories fading. Yet I appreciate more its beauty of 'leaving blank': vast empty spaces in the composition, like blanks in memory, like unknowns in life. Song dynasty paintings often leave three parts filled, seven parts void and solid mutually generating. If this work could advance further, displaying artistic conception within abstraction, revealing temperament within elegant simplicity, it might approach the realm of 'purifying the mind to contemplate the Way.' I once wrote the poem 'What does human life resemble wherever one goes? It should resemble wild geese treading on snow-covered mud. By chance they leave claw marks in the mud, but when the geese fly away, who still cares about east or west?'—traces of memory, like goose claws in snowy mud, random yet precious. I look forward to Mr. Zhang, beyond advancing technique, grasping more profoundly the wonder of 'intention before brush.'",

      "textZh": "审《记忆潮汐--地平线系列》之构图，颇合吾《林泉高致》中「平远」之法。吾尝论山水有「三远」——高远、深远、平远。此作虽非山水，却得平远之神：视线沿地平线延展，空间感由近而远，层次渐隐。然以山水画法论之，此作「势」佳而「韵」尚可深。「势」者，构图之动态也，此作地平线横贯画面，如「千里江山」之气魄，此为佳处。然「韵」者，细节之微妙也，目前画面略显平板，缺乏「虚实相生」「浓淡相宜」之变化。建议张君可学习宋人「米点山水」——虽用抽象点染，却能「点点皆有情」。此作若能在色彩层次、肌理变化上更下功夫，于平淡中求丰富，于简约中见复杂，则境界自高。又，「地平线」作为主题，颇有哲学深意——它是视觉之极限，亦是想象之起点，正如吾所言「远山无皴，远水无波」，越是简单，越见功力。记忆之「潮汐」譬喻亦佳——潮有定时，记忆却无常，此种张力若能在视觉上体现，必更动人。期待张君能在「形」与「神」之间，「技」与「道」之间，找到更好的平衡。",
      "textEn": "Examining the composition of 'Memory Tides - Horizon Series,' it considerably accords with the 'level distance' method from my 'The Lofty Message of Forests and Streams.' I once discussed that landscape has 'three distances'—high distance, deep distance, and level distance. Though this work is not landscape, it captures the spirit of level distance: the viewpoint extends along the horizon line, spatial sense progresses from near to far, layers gradually receding. However, discussing it through landscape painting methods, this work excels in 'momentum' but 'resonance' can still deepen. 'Momentum' refers to compositional dynamics; this work's horizon line spans the picture plane, like the grandeur of 'A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains'—this is its strength. Yet 'resonance' refers to details' subtlety; currently the picture plane appears somewhat flat, lacking changes of 'void and solid mutually generating' and 'concentration and dilution mutually appropriate.' I suggest Mr. Zhang could study Song people's 'Mi Family landscape'—though using abstract dotting and dyeing, achieving 'each dot possessing feeling.' If this work could exert more effort on color gradation and texture variation, seeking richness within plainness, complexity within simplicity, its realm would naturally elevate. Also, 'horizon line' as theme possesses considerable philosophical depth—it is vision's limit yet imagination's starting point, as I said 'distant mountains without texture, distant water without waves'; the simpler, the more it reveals skill. The 'tides' metaphor for memory is also good—tides have fixed times, yet memory is impermanent; if this tension could be visually embodied, it would be more moving. I look forward to Mr. Zhang finding better balance between 'form' and 'spirit,' between 'technique' and 'way.'",

      "textZh": "《记忆潮汐--地平线系列》让我思考艺术中「真实」的问题。在《现代画家》中，我强调艺术必须忠实于自然——不是表面的模仿，而是对自然本质的深刻理解。张君的作品是抽象的，但它忠实吗？我认为是的，因为它忠实于「记忆的本质」——记忆不是照相机般的精确记录，而是模糊的、流动的、会随时间变化的。从这个角度看，抽象的地平线比写实的照片更「真实」，因为它捕捉了记忆的内在特质。然而，我必须追问：这种抽象是艺术家对真理的诚实探索，还是对技术难度的回避？真正的艺术需要艰苦的观察、精确的描绘、对细节的尊重。抽象艺术有时会成为「偷懒」的借口——当画家无法准确描绘自然时，就用「抽象」来掩饰。我不是说张君如此，但我提醒：抽象必须建立在深厚的写实功底之上，必须是「知道如何画但选择不这样画」，而非「不知道如何画所以选择抽象」。如果张君能展示他对真实风景的深刻理解，然后有意识地选择抽象来表达记忆的流动性，那这件作品的价值将大大提升。艺术的道德责任在于诚实——对自然诚实，对观众诚实，对自己诚实。",
      "textEn": "'Memory Tides - Horizon Series' makes me contemplate the question of 'truth' in art. In 'Modern Painters,' I emphasized that art must be faithful to nature—not superficial imitation but profound understanding of nature's essence. Mr. Zhang's work is abstract, but is it faithful? I believe so, because it is faithful to 'memory's essence'—memory is not camera-like precise recording but blurred, fluid, changing with time. From this perspective, the abstract horizon is more 'truthful' than realistic photographs because it captures memory's inherent qualities. However, I must ask: is this abstraction the artist's honest exploration of truth or evasion of technical difficulty? True art requires arduous observation, precise depiction, respect for detail. Abstract art sometimes becomes an excuse for 'laziness'—when painters cannot accurately depict nature, they use 'abstraction' to conceal this. I am not saying Mr. Zhang does this, but I remind: abstraction must be built upon solid realistic foundations, must be 'knowing how to paint but choosing not to paint thus,' not 'not knowing how to paint so choosing abstraction.' If Mr. Zhang can demonstrate his profound understanding of real landscapes, then consciously choose abstraction to express memory's fluidity, this work's value will greatly increase. Art's moral responsibility lies in honesty—honesty toward nature, toward audience, toward oneself.",

      "textZh": "《记忆潮汐》让我想起我们的口述传统。在我们的文化中，记忆不是个人的，而是集体的——当长者讲述部落历史时，每个人的记忆都会被唤醒、被修正、被丰富。这就像潮汐，每次涨潮都会带来新的东西，每次退潮都会留下新的痕迹。张君的地平线让我想起我们村子的视野——当你站在山顶，看向远方，你看到的不仅是地平线，还有祖先走过的路，还有未来孩子们将要走的路。这种时间的连续性，这种过去-现在-未来的共存，正是我们的宇宙观。然而，我也有疑问：这件作品的记忆是谁的记忆？是艺术家个人的记忆，还是集体的记忆？抽象的形式虽然普世，但记忆总是具体的——它属于某个人、某个家族、某个社区。我希望张君能更清楚地表明：这是你的个人记忆，还是你在为某个群体发声？如果是后者，那这个群体是谁？他们的声音在哪里？在我们的传统里，讲故事的人只是管道，真正的声音来自社区。艺术也应该如此——不是艺术家的独白，而是与社区的对话。如果这件作品能邀请观众分享他们自己的「地平线」「潮汐」故事，那它就真正实现了记忆的集体性。",
      "textEn": "'Memory Tides' reminds me of our oral tradition. In our culture, memory is not individual but collective—when elders narrate tribal history, everyone's memory is awakened, corrected, enriched. This is like tides; each high tide brings new things, each low tide leaves new traces. Mr. Zhang's horizon reminds me of our village's vista—when you stand on the hilltop, looking toward the distance, you see not only the horizon but roads ancestors walked, roads future children will walk. This temporal continuity, this coexistence of past-present-future, is precisely our cosmology. However, I also have questions: whose memory is this work's memory? Is it the artist's personal memory or collective memory? Though abstract forms are universal, memory is always specific—it belongs to someone, some family, some community. I hope Mr. Zhang can more clearly indicate: is this your personal memory, or are you speaking for a certain group? If the latter, who is this group? Where are their voices? In our tradition, the storyteller is merely a conduit; the real voice comes from the community. Art should also be thus—not the artist's monologue but dialogue with community. If this work could invite viewers to share their own 'horizon' and 'tide' stories, then it would truly realize memory's collectivity.",

      "textZh": "《记忆潮汐--地平线系列》作为抽象作品，其形式装置值得从俄国形式主义角度分析。什克洛夫斯基的「陌生化」理论认为，艺术的功能是打破自动化感知，使熟悉之物变得陌生。「地平线」作为日常视觉经验，本已「自动化」——我们每天看到它却不再「看见」它。张君通过抽象化处理，剥离了地平线的具体地理特征（是山？是海？），只保留其作为「界限」的本质结构，从而实现了陌生化。观者面对这条线时，被迫重新思考：地平线到底是什么？然而，从「文学性」（literariness）角度，此作尚可深化。俄国形式主义强调「形式对内容的改造」——不是形式服务于内容，而是形式本身创造新的内容。目前此作的形式（抽象地平线）与内容（记忆、时间）之间的关系还较直白——地平线象征记忆的边界，潮汐象征时间的流动，这是「象征」层面的对应，尚未达到形式主义所追求的「形式即内容」的境界。建议可引入更多「结构性矛盾」——例如，让地平线断裂、重叠、扭曲，打破其作为「稳定界限」的常规意义，从而在形式层面上体现记忆的不可靠性与流动性。巴赫金所谓的「对话性」在此作中也可加强——目前是单一的「艺术家-作品-观者」关系，若能引入多重视角的地平线（不同人的记忆地平线），则可构成更复杂的对话结构。",
      "textEn": "'Memory Tides - Horizon Series' as abstract work, its formal device merits analysis from a Russian Formalist perspective. Shklovsky's 'defamiliarization' theory holds that art's function is breaking automatic perception, making the familiar strange. The 'horizon' as everyday visual experience has already been 'automatized'—we see it daily yet no longer truly 'see' it. Mr. Zhang, through abstraction, strips the horizon of specific geographic features (mountain? sea?), retaining only its essence as 'boundary,' thereby achieving defamiliarization. Viewers confronting this line are forced to reconsider: what is the horizon? However, from the perspective of 'literariness,' this work can still deepen. Russian Formalism emphasizes 'form's transformation of content'—not form serving content but form itself creating new content. Currently this work's form (abstract horizon) and content (memory, time) relationship remains rather straightforward—the horizon symbolizes memory's boundary, tides symbolize time's flow; this is correspondence at the 'symbolic' level, not yet achieving Formalism's pursued realm of 'form is content.' I suggest introducing more 'structural contradictions'—for instance, making the horizon fracture, overlap, twist, breaking its conventional meaning as 'stable boundary,' thereby embodying at the formal level memory's unreliability and fluidity. Bakhtin's so-called 'dialogism' can also strengthen in this work—currently it's a singular 'artist-work-viewer' relationship; if multiple perspectives' horizons could be introduced (different people's memory horizons), a more complex dialogic structure could be constructed.",

      "textEn": "'Memory Tides - Horizon Series' provokes reflection on 'digital memory' versus 'human memory.' In contemporary times, we increasingly outsource our memories to digital devices—photos stored in clouds, diaries written on social media, even our walking routes recorded by GPS. This 'digital memory' forms stark contrast with the fluid, blurred 'human memory' in Mr. Zhang's work. Digital memory is precise, permanent, retrievable, while human memory is blurred, mutable, selective. From an ethical perspective, we must ask: when AI can perfectly record and retrieve everything, does this 'imperfect human memory' still have value? I believe so, and very importantly. Human memory's 'imperfection' is precisely its humanity's embodiment—what we choose to remember, to forget, this itself is value judgment and self-definition. Mr. Zhang's work reminds us: memory's blurriness is not defect but feature; memory's fluidity is not weakness but strength. However, this work could also further explore: in the AI era, how do we protect this 'imperfect memory' right? When algorithms can precisely predict and manipulate our memories, how do we resist? Art's responsibility is not merely displaying problems but proposing resistance strategies. If Mr. Zhang could incorporate critique of 'digital memory hegemony' in the work or provide action plans for 'safeguarding human memory,' the work's social value would be greater.",
