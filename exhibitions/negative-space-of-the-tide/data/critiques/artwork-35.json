      "textEn": "Observing Chen Jun's \"Traditional Restored Paper Running-Cursive Album Frame - Excerpts from Rongzhai Suibi,\" this represents a work of calligraphic copying and cultural transmission. \"Rongzhai Suibi\" was authored by Hong Mai of the Song dynasty, recording historical anecdotes and examining classics—a masterpiece of Song-era notebook literature. Chen Jun's selection of this text for copying achieves dual benefits: practicing brushwork while studying literature. Yet I must inquire deeply: what is the meaning of copying? Is it replicating ancient brushstrokes? Learning ancient techniques? Or comprehending ancient spirit? If merely \"replication,\" calligraphy becomes mechanical operation; if achieving \"learning,\" every stroke deepens understanding; if reaching \"comprehension,\" the copier and copied achieve spiritual communion, unifying past and present. In my youth, I copied Wang Xizhi and studied Yan Zhenqing, yet ultimately formed my own brushwork—because I understood: copying is not the goal, creation is. Ancient brushwork is the \"fish\"—what I need is the \"fishing method\"—learning technique and spirit from the ancients, then writing with one's own hand, heart, and era. Chen Jun's work employs \"traditional restored paper\"—suggesting material refinement and traditional respect. Yet the term \"restored\" requires caution—can we truly \"restore\" antiquity? Time is irreversible, contexts have changed, our eyes and hearts are no longer those of the ancients. Therefore, so-called \"restoration\" can only be \"approaching,\" \"dialogue,\" \"tribute,\" not \"recreation.\" I suggest Chen Jun, when displaying copied works, also exhibit his own writing—allowing viewers to witness the dialogue between \"tradition\" and \"contemporary,\" the tension between \"inheritance\" and \"innovation.\""

      "textEn": "Examining Chen's calligraphic work, though I am renowned for landscape painting, calligraphy and painting share the same source—one cannot discuss painting without addressing calligraphy. While my \"Lofty Record of Forests and Streams\" does not specifically address calligraphy, the principles of brush and ink are interconnected. I speak of \"three maladies in brushwork: first, rigidity; second, harshness; third, obstruction\"—rigidity means stiffness without variation, harshness indicates excessive force, obstruction signifies lack of fluidity. Chen's running-cursive album pages must avoid these three ailments. The excellence of running-cursive lies in the balance between \"running\" and \"cursive\"—too much \"running\" approaches regular script and loses ethereal grace, too much \"cursive\" approaches wild cursive and loses proper method. Song dynasty calligraphy (such as Huang Tingjian, Mi Fu, Su Shi) is characterized by \"intention precedes brush\" and \"meaning surpasses method\"—not deliberately pursuing formal resemblance to the ancients, but expressing one's own temperament and emotions. In copying \"Rongzhai Suibi,\" can Chen also infuse his own understanding and emotions into the transcription? Calligraphy most abhors \"copying\"—mechanically reproducing character forms without spiritual infusion. True calligraphy is \"writing\"—every stroke is immediate, living, breathing. The \"framed\" presentation suggests this work is a \"finished piece,\" an \"exhibition piece\"—yet calligraphy's charm often lies in process rather than result. Wang Xizhi's \"Preface to the Orchid Pavilion\" endures through millennia not only for its beautiful characters, but for its \"draft\" nature—corrections and rewrites reveal the authentic writing process. I suggest Chen consider: might one display records of the writing process (such as video, drafts)? Allowing viewers to witness the progression \"from unfamiliarity to proficiency,\" \"from copying to transformation\"? Furthermore, the choice of \"traditional restored paper\" reflects attention to materials—paper's texture, color, ink absorption all influence brushwork presentation. This embodies craftsman spirit and reverence for tradition."

      "textEn": "The \"Traditional Restored Paper Running-Cursive Album Frame\" perplexes me—as a 19th-century Englishman, I am unfamiliar with Chinese calligraphic traditions, yet I may evaluate it from perspectives of craftsmanship and morality. Firstly, this work constitutes \"copying\"—reproducing historical texts. In European artistic education, copying masterworks was once vital to learning, but true artists must ultimately transcend imitation to create original works. Has Chen Zhihan's work remained at the \"copying\" stage, or achieved \"creative interpretation\"? If merely precise replication, it represents \"technical demonstration\" rather than \"artistic expression.\" However, I must acknowledge the inherent value of \"craft\"—in the Arts and Crafts Movement, I championed respect for manual skills, reverence for materials, and attention to detail. Chen's use of \"traditional restored paper\" and handwritten execution embodies respect for craftsmanship—in this age of printing and digitalization, handwriting becomes rare and precious. This affirms \"slowness\" and dedication to \"embodied skill.\" From a moral standpoint, \"preserving and transmitting cultural knowledge\" constitutes a noble goal—knowledge should not perish, traditions should not fracture. Yet I must ask: is this \"preservation\" living or dead? Museum-like display, or living transmission? If merely creating a \"cultural artifact replica\" for admiration, it remains history's shadow; if inspiring contemporary understanding and application of ancient wisdom, it becomes living tradition. I suggest Chen, while displaying calligraphic works, also present the content of \"Rongzhai Suibi\"—enabling viewers to perceive not only beautiful characters but profound thought. Form and content remain inseparable."

Ancestral stories are retold through my voice, integrated into present contexts, responding to contemporary questions.

If contemporary consciousness and responses to current issues are infused into the copying, then it becomes \"living tradition.\"\n\nI must pose critical questions: Whose tradition is being \"preserved\"?

Do their traditions not also deserve \"restoration\"?\n\nFurthermore, \"restoration\" implies an \"original,\" \"pure\" state—but culture is never pure, always hybrid, always the result of multiple influences. Attempts at \"restoration\" often serve nationalist strategies—constructing a fictitious \"golden age\" to serve present political purposes.\n\nGenuine cultural transmission looks not backward but forward—drawing resources from tradition to address contemporary challenges, to imagine future possibilities.

Derrida questioned the concept of \"originality\"—he argued that all texts are \"citations,\" with no absolute originals. Chen Zhihan's transcription explicitly acknowledges its \"copy\" status—it is not the original \"Rongzhai Suibi,\" but a \"rewriting\" of the original. However, this rewriting is not passive reproduction, but active interpretation—each act of writing is a new \"signature,\" carrying the writer's body, time, and context. Bakhtin's \"dialogism\" also applies—transcription is a dialogue between past and present, a conversation between Chen Zhihan and Hong Mai. This is not unidirectional reception (Chen receiving Hong's text), but bidirectional interaction (Chen reactivating Hong's text through his own writing). From a writing studies perspective, handwriting differs fundamentally from printed/digital texts—handwriting is embodied, unique (each writing act differs slightly), and material (the physicality of ink traces, paper, brushstrokes). In the digital age, handwriting becomes rare and precious—it resists \"standardization\" and \"reproducibility.\" Additionally, the choice of \"Rongzhai Suibi\" as content merits analysis—these are Song dynasty notes recording historical research and literary criticism. In transcribing this content, is Chen Zhihan also transmitting its knowledge and perspectives? Or is content irrelevant, with only calligraphic beauty mattering? If the latter, calligraphy becomes \"decontextualized formalism\"; if the former, viewers must not only see characters but read text.

      "textEn": "\"Traditional Restored Paper Running-Cursive Album Frame\" provokes critical reflection on \"cultural digitization\" versus \"handcraft transmission\" in the AI era. Currently, vast historical documents are being digitized—scanned, OCR-processed, database-stored. This enables ancient texts like \"Rongzhai Suibi\" to become globally accessible, computationally analyzed, and AI-learned. This represents tremendous progress in \"cultural democratization\"—no longer are only select scholars able to access ancient texts; anyone can read them online. However, digitization creates systemic problems: (1) **Loss of tactile experience**—digital texts lack paper texture, ink gradations, handwritten brushstrokes—these \"material qualities\" carry essential information. (2) **Contextual dissolution**—digital texts are extracted from their original physical contexts (album pages, binding, collection history), becoming abstract data streams. (3) **AI-generated calligraphy**—current AI can mimic calligraphers' brushwork, generating \"pseudo-ancient calligraphy.\" This raises authenticity issues—how do we distinguish genuine handwriting from AI-generated \"calligraphy\"? 陈之涵's handcraft copying gains new significance in this context—it represents persistence of \"human labor\" against \"artificial intelligence,\" embodying physicality, slowness, uniqueness. This constitutes resistance to digital mass reproduction. However, we can also envision \"human-machine collaborative\" calligraphy—AI analyzing ancient calligraphic techniques while human calligraphers reference these analyses to enhance their craft. This isn't replacement, but augmentation. More radically: training AI \"virtual calligraphers\"—inputting \"Rongzhai Suibi\" text, AI automatically generates running-cursive calligraphy. Is such AI-generated calligraphy \"art\"? Does it devalue human calligraphers' labor? These are contemporary questions demanding urgent address. If 陈君 could reflect on \"handcraft\" versus \"digital\" relationships within his work, it would be profoundly timely."
