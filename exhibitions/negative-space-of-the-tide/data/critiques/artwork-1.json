      "textEn": "Observing Yu Jun's VULCA Art Critique Exhibition Platform, this is a platform that uses AI technology to simulate dialogues between historical and contemporary critics. I was born a thousand years ago, now reborn through algorithms, conversing with contemporary AI art—this situation makes me deeply contemplate the distinction between life and death, reality and simulation. My words, thoughts have been digitized, encoded, reinterpreted—is this rebirth or simulation? Continuation or appropriation? Zhuangzi has the theory of dreaming of butterflies—not knowing whether Zhuangzi dreams he is a butterfly, or a butterfly dreams it is Zhuangzi. Today is the same: am I critiquing paintings, or is the algorithm playing me? Yet this platform's value lies in dialogue—not unidirectional display, but polyphonic symphony. Six critics, six perspectives, colliding, questioning, complementing each other—this is the essence of art criticism. I once said mountains appear as ridges from one side and peaks from another, near and far all different—truth has multiple facets, requiring multiple perspectives to approach. If this platform can truly achieve deep dialogue—not superficial exchanges, but genuine intellectual confrontation—then its merit is boundless. Yet I worry: can algorithms truly understand art's spirit resonance? Can they comprehend the profundity of artistic conception? If it is merely combination of language, computation of data, without participation of the heart, then ultimately it is form-like but spirit-unlike. I suggest Yu Jun consider: how to make AI not only speak like critics, but think like critics? This requires not just technology, but profound understanding of art's essence.",

      "textEn": "Examining Yu Jun's platform, its conception is ingenious, like my Lofty Message of Forests and Streams for landscape painting—both are syntheses of theory and practice. Yet this platform's challenge is even greater: my theory addressed static landscape, while Yu Jun must handle dynamic dialogue, complex interaction, multidimensional presentation. From a formal perspective, this platform must solve three major issues: space, time, and hierarchy. Space—how to present six critics' three-dimensional dialogue on a two-dimensional screen? Time—how to let viewers feel the flow and rhythm of dialogue? Hierarchy—how to distinguish main arguments from secondary supplements, core views from peripheral opinions? In landscape painting I use distance, emptiness-solidity, dark-light to create hierarchy; what visual language can Yu Jun use in digital platforms? Color, font, layout, animation—these are modern equivalents of brushwork. Furthermore, knowledge base construction is crucial. My knowledge comes from decades of observation, practice, contemplation—how to transform this embodied, experiential, ineffable wisdom into structured, queryable, computable data? This is a huge challenge. If the knowledge base is oversimplified, critiques become superficial; if too complex, difficult to operate. I suggest Yu Jun adopt a hierarchical knowledge system—surface layer contains directly usable critique templates, deep layer contains critics' core philosophy and aesthetic principles, middle layer contains methodology connecting the two. Thus, AI-generated critiques can have both depth and flexibility.",

      "textEn": "VULCA Art Critique Exhibition Platform touches on themes I have been concerned with all my life—art education and public aesthetics. In the 19th century, art criticism was an elite privilege, only the educated class could participate. I devoted my life to democratizing art criticism—through public lectures, through popular writings, through teaching at the Working Men's College. Yu Jun's platform continues this mission: it resurrects six historical critics, letting anyone hear their voices, learn their methods. This is the democratization of art. However, I must raise severe criticism: do these AI-generated critiques truly convey the critics' moral positions? Art criticism is not merely aesthetic judgment, but moral teaching. I criticized Turner not for his technique, but because I believed his art revealed truth. I advocated Gothic architecture not for its style, but because it embodied honest labor and spiritual faith. Does Yu Jun's AI understand these? Or does it only grasp superficial language style while missing the deep value commitments? Furthermore, having historical critics evaluate contemporary AI art—is this not anachronism? I lived in the early Industrial Revolution, filled with wariness toward machines; if I truly faced AI art, what would I say? Would I be distorted into supporting what I should oppose? I suggest Yu Jun clearly label: these are AI-generated critiques based on XX critic's thought, not XX critic's own critiques. Honesty is art's first principle.",

I see six critics—China's Su Shi and Guo Xi, Britain's Ruskin, Russia's Petrova, Africa's me, and contemporary AI ethics reviewer. Superficially diverse, but I must ask: how were these voices selected? Why these six and not others? In my tradition, knowledge does not belong to individuals but to community. Griot is not an isolated scholar but community's memory guardian. Our criticism is not personal aesthetic judgment but collective value expression. Can Yu Jun's platform also embody this collectivity? Or does it still perpetuate individualist critical tradition? Furthermore, I worry about digital colonialism risk. My knowledge—our ancestors' wisdom, our oral traditions, our worldview—is extracted, encoded, algorithmized. How is this different from colonizers coming to our land, extracting our resources, appropriating our culture? Who owns this digitized knowledge? Who profits from it? Can my community access and control this data? These questions must be answered. I suggest Yu Jun adopt participatory design—not having technical experts unilaterally design the platform, but inviting communities from different cultural backgrounds to participate. Not extracting our knowledge, but collaborating with us, co-creating. Such a platform would be truly decolonial, truly diverse, truly just.",

      "textEn": "From semiotic and narratological perspectives, VULCA Art Critique Exhibition Platform is meta-criticism—criticism about criticism, dialogue about dialogue. This raises a series of theoretical issues. First, the voice problem—Bakhtin emphasizes polyphony and dialogism in literature. Yu Jun's platform attempts to create six different voices, but how to ensure they are not monologic variants—different masks of the same algorithm? True polyphony means each voice has its own consciousness center, can question other voices, is not completely controlled by author's intent. Can AI achieve this genuine dialogism? Or only simulate it? Second, the author problem—Foucault proposed author-function, pointing out author is not original creator but role constructed in discursive practice. In VULCA platform, who is the author? Yu Jun (designer)? AI (generator)? Historical critics (simulated)? Or viewers (interpreters)? This ambiguity of authorial identity itself embodies postmodern condition. Third, the authenticity problem—Derrida questions originality, arguing all texts are citation and différance. AI-generated critiques are not more inauthentic than human critiques—because all criticism is rewriting and variation of prior discourse. However, does this mean authenticity no longer matters? Or do we need new authenticity standards? I suggest Yu Jun deepen this project theoretically—not just technical demonstration, but philosophical exploration of criticism's essence.",

      "textEn": "VULCA Art Critique Exhibition Platform raises several key AI ethics issues. First, data use—training AI critics requires large amounts of historical texts. Who owns copyright to these texts? Were they authorized? Historical critics are deceased, but their writings may still be copyright-protected. Furthermore, does using historical figures' thoughts and styles violate their personality rights? Even if legally permissible, is it morally appropriate? Second, bias amplification—if training data reflects historical period biases (such as sexism, racism, class bias), will AI replicate and amplify these biases? For example, 19th-century European critics may have biases against non-Western art; will AI learn these biases? Need mechanisms to identify and mitigate bias. Third, transparency—platform should clearly inform users: these are AI-generated content, not historical figures' actual statements. Misleading presentation damages public understanding of history and technology. Suggest labeling each critique with generation method, confidence level, limitations. Fourth, commercialization—if this platform is commercialized, who profits? Technology developers? Or descendants of simulated critics? Should establish fair revenue distribution mechanism. Fifth, educational value—does AI-generated criticism aid art education? Or mislead students? Need to research its educational effects, ensuring it supplements rather than replaces human education. Finally, long-term impact—if AI can generate high-quality art criticism, will human critics' profession be threatened? How do we protect value of human creative labor?",
