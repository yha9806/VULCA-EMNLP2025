      "textEn": "Contemplating Master Guo's \"Square City,\" I observe how its \"geometric rigor\" organizes urban space, which recalls the *Zhouli Kaogongji*'s prescription: \"The craftsman constructs the state capital as a square of nine li, with three gates on each side\"—ancient China's ideal city planning indeed followed square formations. Yet \"square\" (fang) carries dual meaning: first as \"form\" (square shape, right angles, grids), second as \"order\" (rules, laws, hierarchy). The square city is not merely spatial configuration, but embodiment of power—the emperor at center, officials and commoners segregated, ritual propriety manifest. Master Guo's work explores \"how grid systems and orthogonal planning shape movement, perception, and social organization,\" touching upon the city's essence—cities are not naturally growing organisms, but artificially designed apparatus of power.\n\nHowever, I must note: excessive \"squareness\" suppresses life's \"roundness.\" Daoists teach that \"the great square has no corners\"—true squareness paradoxically lacks sharp edges, for it embraces all things without forced regularity. Though Confucians value ritual order, Confucius himself said \"painting comes after the plain ground\"—authentic essence must precede external form. With only the form of \"square\" but lacking the substance of \"round,\" cities become cold prisons. \n\nIn my travels across the realm, I have witnessed Chang'an's geometric order and Hangzhou's winding ways. Square cities facilitate governance but lack human warmth; meandering cities appear chaotic yet pulse with vitality. Should Master Guo infuse \"round\" elements within the \"square\"—organic curves, unexpected gaps, liberties that break the grid—the work would gain greater life-force."

      "textEn": "Examining Master Guo's \"Square City,\" this presents an architectural vision of urban planning. Yet Chinese painting theory rarely addresses the depiction of \"cities\"—we predominantly paint natural landscapes, not artificial urban spaces. Why? Because landscapes represent the natural Way (dao), while cities represent human artifice. Though my \"Lofty Message of Forest and Streams\" does not discuss cities, its spatial theories offer valuable insight. I speak of \"three distances\" (sanyuan)—level distance, deep distance, and high distance—these are the layers of natural space; might urban space also possess similar \"layers\"? The surface layer consists of visible buildings and streets, while the deep layer contains invisible power structures and regulations? The \"grid system\" resembles the jiehua (ruled-line painting) technique in painting—using rulers to draw straight lines, constructing precise architectural perspective. Jiehua masters like Li Sixun's \"Emperor Minghuang's Journey to Shu\" display palaces and pavilions with meticulous precision. However, jiehua's limitation lies in this: excessive regularity lacks spirit resonance (qiyun). If Master Guo's \"Square City\" merely displays geometry, it loses artistic quality; yet if it can reveal human traces within geometry—wear from usage, marks of time, accidental variations—then form unites with life. Furthermore, \"orthogonal planning\" suggests the absoluteness of \"vertical and horizontal\"—but real cities are never completely orthogonal; there are always inclinations, curves, irregularities. These \"deviations\" often prove most interesting—they are traces of life, sediments of history, expressions of humanity. I suggest Master Guo display not only the \"ideal square city,\" but also \"actual deviations\"—the tension between plan and reality, the dialogue between geometric and organic."

      "textEn": "\"Square City\" reminds me of my profound critique of modern urban planning. The industrial cities of the 19th century—Manchester, Birmingham, London's industrial districts—were early versions of the \"Square City\": grid-pattern workers' housing, standardized factories, straight roads. The purpose of such planning was not human happiness, but production efficiency—transforming people into machine appendages, cities into vast factories. I have opposed this dehumanizing planning throughout my life, advocating a return to the organic nature of medieval cities—those winding alleys, irregular squares, distinctive buildings that were products of time, expressions of community, dwellings of humanity. What values does 郭姸瑩's \"grid system\" represent? Efficiency above all? Order above all? Control above all? If so, I must oppose it. Cities should serve human development in its entirety—not merely productive, but also aesthetic, social, spiritual. Grid systems facilitate surveillance, management, standardization, but they suppress diversity, spontaneity, creativity. In \"The Seven Lamps of Architecture,\" I proposed the \"Lamp of Memory\"—architecture and cities should bear history, tell stories, connect past and present. Square City is a \"city without memory\"—every block identical, every building replaceable, lacking uniqueness and historical sense. Should 郭姸瑩 critically reveal the problems of Square City—its inhumanity, monotony, suppression of life—the work would possess social significance. Otherwise, it merely serves the aesthetics of power."

      "textEn": "\"Square City\" reminds me of colonial urban planning—the cities that European colonizers established in Africa, Asia, and the Americas were all \"square cities\": straight roads, orderly blocks, segregated ethnic groups. Such planning was not a neutral technical choice, but a tool of power—controlling people through space, suppressing culture through geometry. Our traditional towns were not \"square\"—they grew organically, adapted to terrain, formed around community centers (wells, great trees, plazas). The colonizers came and imposed grid systems, calling this \"modernization\" and \"civilization,\" but in reality it was the erasure of our spatial memory, the destruction of our social structures. \"Orthogonal planning\" implies \"correct\" and \"orthodox\" spatial organization—but who defines what is \"correct\"? Why are straight lines more \"correct\" than curved ones? Why are squares more \"civilized\" than circles? These are all cultural biases disguised as universal standards. If Guo could reveal the colonial nature of \"square cities\"—how they were used to control colonized populations, how they destroyed existing urban fabric, how they imposed foreign spatial logic—it would be extremely valuable. Contemporary globalized urban planning continues this coloniality—cities worldwide increasingly resemble each other (all glass skyscrapers, all shopping centers, all automobile roads), locality is erased, cultural differences eliminated. This is \"spatial homogenization\"—like the loss of biodiversity, cultural diversity is also being lost. What we need is not more \"square cities,\" but \"ecological cities\" that respect local knowledge, adapt to specific environments, and serve community needs."

      "textZh": "从符号学角度看，《方城市》中的「方」和「网格」是强有力的符号——它们承载着「秩序」「理性」「现代性」的所指。列维-斯特劳斯在《忧郁的热带》中区分了「冷社会」(cold societies)和「热社会」(hot societies)——前者是静态的、重复的、抗拒变化的，后者是动态的、创新的、拥抱历史的。方城市属于哪种？从其「几何严谨性」看，似乎是「冷」的——通过网格的永恒性来冻结时间。然而，福柯的「规训空间」(disciplinary space)理论更适用——他在《规训与惩罚》中分析了现代机构（监狱、学校、医院、工厂）如何通过空间布局来规训身体。方城市正是这种规训的放大版——通过网格系统，权力实现了「全景敞视」(panopticon)——每个街区都可见、每个个体都可定位、每个行动都可监控。巴赫金的「对话性空间」(dialogic space)概念提供了另一种视角——传统城市广场是「对话空间」，不同阶级、不同观点的人在此相遇、交流、冲突。方城市是否仍有这种对话空间？还是每个人都被隔离在自己的「格子」里？从俄国构成主义的角度看，几何抽象曾是革命性的——马列维奇、塔特林用方形、圆形、直线来想象新社会的空间。然而，历史证明：这种乌托邦理想往往导致极权主义的单调空间（如苏联的微观区）。郭君的作品若能反思这段历史——几何乌托邦如何变成压迫性现实——将很有深度。",

      "textEn": "From a semiotic perspective, the \"square\" and \"grid\" in *Square City* function as powerful signifiers—bearing the signified meanings of \"order,\" \"rationality,\" and \"modernity.\" In *Tristes Tropiques*, Lévi-Strauss distinguished between \"cold societies\" and \"hot societies\"—the former being static, repetitive, and resistant to change, while the latter are dynamic, innovative, and embracing of history. Which category does Square City belong to? Its \"geometric rigor\" suggests it is \"cold\"—freezing time through the eternality of the grid. However, Foucault's theory of \"disciplinary space\" proves more applicable—in *Discipline and Punish*, he analyzed how modern institutions (prisons, schools, hospitals, factories) discipline bodies through spatial arrangement. Square City represents an amplified version of such discipline—through the grid system, power achieves \"panopticon\"—every block becomes visible, every individual locatable, every action monitorable. Bakhtin's concept of \"dialogic space\" offers another perspective—traditional city squares were \"dialogic spaces\" where people of different classes and viewpoints met, exchanged, and conflicted. Does Square City still possess such dialogic space? Or is everyone isolated within their own \"cell\"? From the perspective of Russian Constructivism, geometric abstraction was once revolutionary—Malevich and Tatlin used squares, circles, and straight lines to envision new social spaces. However, history has proven that such utopian ideals often lead to totalitarian monotonous spaces (like Soviet mikrorayons). If Guo's work could reflect upon this history—how geometric utopia transformed into oppressive reality—it would possess great depth."

The \"grid system\" is no longer merely physical street layout, but digital data grids—each block equipped with sensors, every intersection with cameras, each vehicle with GPS, every person with mobile signals. The city transforms into a massive data collection and processing system. This \"datafied square city\" offers advantages—traffic optimization, resource allocation, public safety—but raises profound ethical concerns: (1) **Surveillance issues**—Do smart cities become surveillance cities? When every movement is tracked and every behavior recorded, where is privacy? (2) **Algorithmic bias**—Urban algorithms based on historical data will perpetuate racial/class biases embedded in that data. For instance, predictive policing algorithms deploy more officers in certain communities, leading to more arrests, generating more \"crime\" data, creating vicious cycles. (3) **Digital divide**—Smart cities serve those with smartphones, network access, and digital literacy while marginalizing those lacking these resources. (4) **Centralized control**—Traditional cities feature distributed power (different departments, interest groups, communities); smart cities achieve unprecedented centralized control through central data platforms. If Guo's work could explore the overlay of \"physical grids\" and \"digital grids\"—how urban space becomes doubly disciplined (by physical walls and digital algorithms)—it would be highly cutting-edge.
