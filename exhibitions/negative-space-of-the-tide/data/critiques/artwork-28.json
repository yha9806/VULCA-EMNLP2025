      "textEn": "Observing Liu Jun's \"Walking with Difficulty,\" its title strikes at the heart of contemporary human predicament—where each path proves arduous, every step meets obstruction. Throughout my life of wandering exile, from the capital to Huangzhou, from Huangzhou to Huizhou, from Huizhou to Danzhou, each step has been fraught with difficulty. Yet I have come to understand: \"walking with difficulty\" encompasses both external obstacles and internal attachments. External obstacles—societal oppression, interference from others, environmental constraints—these constitute \"objective difficulties.\" Internal attachments—personal expectations, desire's compulsions, the bondage of goals—these form \"subjective difficulties.\" Their interweaving creates the \"path of hardship.\"\n\nThis work depicts \"struggle, persistence, and constrained movement,\" emphasizing \"making hidden obstacles visible, revealing embodied knowledge\"—this is profoundly significant. Often, true obstacles are not obvious walls but invisible rules, internalized taboos, habitual constraints. These \"invisible barriers\" prove more formidable because we remain unconscious of their existence. Buddhism speaks of \"ignorance\"—not knowing that one doesn't know, this constitutes the deepest obstacle.\n\nThere is a Chan koan: a monk asks \"What is the patriarch's intent in coming from the West?\" The master replies \"The cypress tree in the courtyard.\" The monk seeks profound answers, unknowing that the obstacle is \"seeking\" itself—once seeking is released, the answer stands before one's eyes.\n\nShould this work, while expressing struggle, also intimate the possibility of \"releasing struggle,\" it would possess greater Chan essence. In \"walking with difficulty,\" the \"difficulty\" represents suffering; in \"walking despite difficulty,\" the \"walking\" embodies courage; in \"non-attachment to walking,\" the \"stillness\" manifests wisdom. Only when these three unite does one achieve a complete life attitude."

      "textZh": "审刘君《举步维艰》，此为行为与装置之结合,与传统山水画不同，却有相通之理。山水画中「行旅」是重要母题——《溪山行旅图》《早春图》中都有行人艰难前行的身影。为何画行旅？因为「行」象征人生，「路」象征选择，「山水」象征世界。行旅的艰难——陡峭的山路、湍急的溪流、迷蒙的雾霭——正是人生困境的隐喻。然山水画的智慧在于：虽画「艰」，却有「通」——山重水复疑无路，柳暗花明又一村。画中的道路虽然曲折,却总有出路；行人虽然渺小，却坚定前行。这是儒家的「知其不可而为之」，也是道家的「曲则全」。刘君之作若是行为艺术，「表演的身体」至关重要——身体的姿态、移动的速度、呼吸的节奏，都传达「艰难」的质感。中国戏曲有「程式化动作」——通过特定的身法表现不同情境。如「趟马」表现骑马，「圆场」表现长途行走。此作是否也可借鉴——通过形式化的动作，让「艰难」变得可见、可感？此外，「装置」的空间如何设置？是真实的物理障碍（如狭窄的通道、高低不平的地面），还是心理的象征障碍（如迷宫般的布局、无尽的循环）？山水画讲「可行、可望、可游、可居」，此作讲的是「不可行」——但「不可行」如何在空间中呈现？这是艺术家需解决的形式问题。",

      "textEn": "Examining Liu Jun's \"Walking with Difficulty,\" this work combines performance and installation art, differing from traditional landscape painting yet sharing fundamental principles. In landscape painting, \"journey\" serves as a vital motif—both \"Travelers Among Mountains and Streams\" and \"Early Spring\" depict figures struggling forward with difficulty. Why paint journeys? Because \"walking\" symbolizes life, \"path\" symbolizes choice, and \"landscape\" symbolizes the world. The hardships of travel—steep mountain paths, rushing streams, misty vapors—serve as metaphors for life's predicaments. Yet landscape painting's wisdom lies in this: though depicting \"difficulty,\" it contains \"passage\"—where mountains and waters seem to block the way, willows and flowers reveal another village. The paths in paintings, though winding, always offer outlets; the travelers, though small, advance with determination. This embodies the Confucian \"acting despite knowing impossibility\" and the Daoist \"wholeness through yielding.\"\n\nIf Liu Jun's work functions as performance art, the \"performing body\" becomes paramount—bodily posture, movement tempo, breathing rhythm all convey the texture of \"difficulty.\" Chinese opera employs \"stylized movements\"—specific physical techniques expressing different situations. \"Tangma\" represents horseback riding; \"yuanchang\" represents long-distance walking. Could this work similarly borrow—through formalized actions, making \"difficulty\" visible and tangible?\n\nFurthermore, how should the \"installation\" space be configured? Through actual physical obstacles (narrow passages, uneven terrain), or psychological symbolic barriers (labyrinthine layouts, endless loops)? Landscape painting speaks of \"walkable, viewable, wanderable, inhabitable,\" while this work addresses the \"unwalkable\"—but how does \"unwalkable\" manifest spatially? This remains the formal problem the artist must resolve."

      "textEn": "\"Walking with Difficulty\" recalls my longstanding concern for the suffering of laborers. The working class of the Victorian era—their very existence was \"walking with difficulty\"—enduring long hours, meager wages, wretched conditions, and no security. Their bodies bore the violence of capitalism: bent spines, roughened hands, weary eyes. If art can make the privileged classes \"see\" such hardship—not as abstract statistics, but as embodied experience—it would possess immense moral value. Should 刘坤's work be performance or installation art, the key lies in the mechanism of \"empathy\"—how to make viewers truly \"feel\" difficulty, rather than merely \"observe\" it? I suggest: engage viewers as \"participants\" rather than \"spectators.\" For instance, create real physical obstacles—viewers must navigate narrow passages, climb steep steps, walk on uneven surfaces—letting their bodies experience \"difficulty.\" This is not torturing the audience, but educating them—allowing brief experience to illuminate the prolonged struggles of countless others. However, I must warn against the danger of \"aestheticizing suffering.\" To transform others' pain into artistic material, gallery exhibits, elite consumption—this is immoral. 刘坤 must clarify: are you \"revealing\" suffering or \"consuming\" it? Does your work advance genuine social change (such as advocating accessible facilities for the disabled, reasonable working hours for laborers), or does it merely prompt viewers to sigh momentarily before returning to their comfortable lives? Art must serve justice, otherwise it is merely refined cruelty."

      "textEn": "\"Walking with Difficulty\" reminds me of our ancestors' own \"walking with difficulty\" under the slave trade and colonial rule—literal \"shackles\" restricting movement, symbolic \"oppression\" restricting freedom. Yet our history is not merely suffering, but the resilience of \"walking despite difficulty\"—our ancestors survived, resisted, created, and transmitted culture under the harshest conditions. This resilience is not passive endurance, but active resistance—through preserving our languages, our rituals, our stories, we created \"possibility\" within \"impossibility.\" Liu Kun's work would be more complete if it could manifest this \"power of walking despite difficulty\"—not only the weight of \"obstacles,\" but also the courage of \"overcoming.\"\n\nIn our tradition, \"walking\" carries profound spiritual meaning—pilgrimage journeys, initiation rites, migration stories all involve difficult walking. This walking is not about \"arriving\" somewhere, but \"becoming\" someone in the process. The difficulty of \"walking with difficulty\" itself becomes a medium of transformation—through overcoming obstacles, we become stronger, wiser, more qualified to join the ranks of our ancestors. Therefore, this work should not merely \"display predicament,\" but \"celebrate overcoming.\"\n\nFurthermore, embodied knowledge is paramount in our tradition—our knowledge resides not in books but in bodies—how to farm, weave, dance, heal are all learned through the body. \"Walking with difficulty\" is also embodied knowledge—only those who have truly experienced obstacles know how to navigate them. If Liu Kun's installation could transmit this knowledge—not telling viewers \"what difficulty is,\" but enabling them to \"learn how to navigate difficulty\"—it would possess practical value."

      "textZh": "从叙事学角度看，《举步维艰》是「受阻的叙事」(blocked narrative)——主人公想要前进，但遇到障碍。这是最古老的叙事模式之一——《奥德赛》中奥德修斯的归乡之路充满障碍，《西游记》中唐僧的取经之路历经九九八十一难。然而，重要的是：叙事的意义不在于「克服障碍」（那是结果），而在于「如何克服」（那是过程）——是通过智慧？通过力量？通过运气？通过帮助？不同的方式揭示不同的价值观。刘君的作品若是行为艺术，「表演者」如何应对障碍？是挣扎？是放弃？是寻找捷径？是改变目标？这些「应对策略」本身就是作品的意义。从俄国形式主义的「情节」(plot)理论看，障碍是「延宕」(retardation)的装置——它延缓故事的进程，创造张力和期待。没有障碍，就没有叙事——「他想回家，然后他回家了」，这不是故事。必须有「他想回家，但遇到风暴、怪物、诱惑、背叛，最终经过千辛万苦才回家」,这才是故事。因此，「举步维艰」不是叙事的问题，而是叙事的本质。巴赫金的「时空体」(chronotope)概念也相关——「道路」是特殊的时空体，在道路上，不同阶级、不同身份的人相遇、对话、冲突。道路是社会的缩影、是命运的隐喻。刘君的「艰难之路」是哪种道路？是个人的（心理的障碍）？是社会的（结构的不公）？是存在的（生命的本质）？明确这一点，将决定作品的哲学深度。",

      "textEn": "From a narratological perspective, \"Walking with Difficulty\" represents a \"blocked narrative\"—the protagonist seeks to advance but encounters obstacles. This constitutes one of the most ancient narrative patterns—Odysseus's homeward journey in *The Odyssey* is fraught with impediments, while the monk Xuanzang's pilgrimage in *Journey to the West* endures eighty-one tribulations. However, what matters crucially is this: narrative significance lies not in \"overcoming obstacles\" (that is the outcome), but in \"how to overcome them\" (that is the process)—through wisdom? Through strength? Through fortune? Through assistance? Different approaches reveal different value systems. If Liu Kun's work functions as performance art, how does the \"performer\" respond to obstacles? Through struggle? Through surrender? Through seeking shortcuts? Through changing objectives? These \"coping strategies\" themselves constitute the work's meaning. From Russian Formalism's theory of \"plot,\" obstacles serve as devices of \"retardation\"—they delay the story's progression, creating tension and expectation. Without obstacles, there exists no narrative—\"he wanted to go home, then he went home\" is not a story. There must be \"he wanted to go home, but encountered storms, monsters, temptations, betrayals, and finally returned home after countless hardships\"—this constitutes story. Therefore, \"walking with difficulty\" is not narrative's problem, but narrative's essence. Bakhtin's concept of \"chronotope\" is also relevant—the \"road\" represents a special chronotope where people of different classes and identities meet, dialogue, and conflict. The road serves as society's microcosm, destiny's metaphor. What kind of road is Liu Kun's \"difficult path\"? Is it personal (psychological barriers)? Social (structural injustice)? Existential (life's essence)? Clarifying this point will determine the work's philosophical depth."

      "textEn": "\"Walking with Difficulty\" provokes reflection on \"algorithmic barriers\" in the AI era. Today, our \"movements\" are increasingly mediated by algorithms—we seek employment, but recruitment algorithms filter out our resumes; we apply for loans, but credit algorithms reject our applications; we attempt to speak, but recommendation algorithms limit our visibility. These constitute new forms of \"walking with difficulty\"—invisible, automated, seemingly neutral obstacles. Worse still, these algorithmic barriers often reinforce existing inequalities—if historical data indicates a certain demographic is \"high risk,\" algorithms impose higher barriers on that group, creating a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" Furthermore, \"accessibility\" assumes new meaning in the digital age—the digital barriers faced by disabled individuals (such as webpages unrecognizable to screen readers, videos without subtitles, interfaces requiring fine motor control) represent the digital version of \"walking with difficulty.\" However, AI can also \"remove barriers\"—voice recognition assists those with mobility impairments, image recognition aids the visually impaired, machine translation helps those with language barriers. This is the promise of \"assistive technology.\" The question remains: who designs these technologies? Who decides which barriers to remove? Often, those in power design technology according to their needs and imagination, with the result that barriers for mainstream groups are eliminated while barriers for marginalized groups are ignored or even exacerbated. If 刘坤's work could explore \"visible barriers\" versus \"invisible barriers\"—physical obstacles are easily identified and addressed, while algorithmic barriers remain hidden and difficult to challenge—it would be extremely timely. I suggest considering: could we design \"algorithmic barrier visualization\"—allowing viewers to experience the sensation of \"algorithmic rejection\"? For instance, viewers must pass through certain \"checkpoints,\" but the system rejects them based on randomly assigned characteristics, enabling them to experience the frustration of \"invisible discrimination.\""
