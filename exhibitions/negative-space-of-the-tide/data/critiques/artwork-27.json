      "textZh": "再观《辩白书》（张君之作），其与吴君同题，当有不同侧重。张君强调「质疑证明自身存在与选择的义务」，直指更根本的哲学问题——「我」是否需要证明自己存在？「我」的选择是否需要他人批准？此让吾想起禅宗公案「父母未生前，何处是本来面目」——本来面目不需证明，一旦需要证明，已非本来面目。然人处世间，终不能免俗。儒家讲「修身、齐家、治国、平天下」,似乎人必须不断证明自己——向家族、向朝廷、向历史。然吾经黄州之贬、惠州之贬、儋州之贬，屡次失去「证明自己」的机会，反而悟得「无待」之境——我的价值不需要外界的承认，我的存在不需要他人的批准。「一蓑烟雨任平生」，是超越了「辩白」的自在。张君此作若能区分「被动的辩白」与「主动的沉默」，将更有深度。「被动的辩白」是在他人的审判框架内为自己辩护，最终强化了审判者的权威；「主动的沉默」是拒绝进入辩白的游戏，拒绝接受审判的前提，以沉默来解构权力。老子言「知者不言，言者不知」，庄子讲「言无言」,都是这个道理。然而，「沉默」也可能是无力的、被迫的——弱者的沉默不是智慧，而是压迫。因此，此作需要细致区分不同情境下的「沉默」与「辩白」。",

      "textEn": "Examining the \"Letter of Explanation\" (by Zhang), which shares the same subject as Wu's work, yet carries different emphasis. Zhang stresses the \"obligation to question and prove one's own existence and choices,\" pointing directly to a more fundamental philosophical question—must the \"self\" prove its existence? Do one's choices require others' approval? This reminds me of the Chan Buddhist koan: \"Before your parents were born, what was your original face?\"—the original face needs no proof; once proof is required, it is no longer the original face. Yet dwelling in this world, one cannot entirely escape convention.\n\nConfucianism speaks of \"cultivating the self, regulating the family, governing the state, bringing peace to the world\"—suggesting humans must constantly prove themselves to family, court, and history. However, through my banishments to Huangzhou, Huizhou, and Danzhou, repeatedly losing opportunities to \"prove myself,\" I instead awakened to the realm of \"wu dai\" (non-dependence)—my worth needs no external recognition, my existence requires no others' approval. \"In straw raincoat through misty rain, I accept whatever life brings\"—this transcends the need for explanation, achieving natural ease.\n\nShould Zhang's work distinguish between \"passive explanation\" and \"active silence,\" it would gain greater depth. \"Passive explanation\" defends oneself within others' judgment framework, ultimately reinforcing the judge's authority; \"active silence\" refuses to enter the game of explanation, rejecting the premise of judgment, using silence to deconstruct power. Laozi said \"Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\" Zhuangzi taught \"speaking without speaking\"—the same principle applies.\n\nYet \"silence\" may also be powerless, forced—the weak's silence is not wisdom, but oppression. Therefore, this work must carefully distinguish between \"silence\" and \"explanation\" across different contexts."

      "textEn": "Re-examining \"Letter of Explanation\" (by Zhang), how do the \"visual and textual elements\" of this work combine? Text as content is one matter; text as image is entirely another. Chinese calligraphy is precisely the art that unifies both—Wang Xizhi's \"Preface to the Orchid Pavilion,\" whose content records an elegant gathering while its form exemplifies calligraphic mastery, the two inseparable. If Zhang's work could visually present the \"tension of explanation\"—the struggle of words, the fracture of language, the difficulty of expression—it would possess greater artistic impact. I suggest several possible visual strategies: (1) **Revision and rewriting**—initial drafts crossed out, amended, rewritten, displaying the process rather than the result of \"explanation,\" revealing self-doubt and repeated deliberation. (2) **Incomplete text**—certain key words missing, certain sentences interrupted, suggesting the powerlessness of \"explanation\" and the failure of language. (3) **Multi-layered overlay**—different versions of explanation letters superimposed in the same space, some clear, some blurred, forming a complex textual landscape. (4) **Void and negative space**—abundant blank areas, like the negative space in Chinese painting, suggesting that the \"unspoken\" portions are often more important than the \"spoken\" ones. Furthermore, material choice conveys attitude—formal document paper or casual draft paper? Ink writing or pencil sketches? Zhang's exploration of \"responsibility, agency, and resistance\" requires formal embodiment of this \"resistance\"—not perfect, rule-conforming explanation, but fragmented, rebellious text that refuses disciplining. Landscape painting speaks of \"untrammeled style\" (yige)—freedom that transcends established rules. If this work could achieve textual \"untrammeled style,\" its artistic realm would be profound and far-reaching."

I once believed art could change society, that beauty could awaken morality, that artists bore responsibility to speak for justice. Yet my later years were filled with disillusionment—my appeals were ignored, my ideals mocked, capitalism continued ruthlessly crushing all that was beautiful. Therefore, I understand the weariness and anger of this \"explanation.\" Zhang Jun, what form does your \"resistance\" take? Is it open declaration or secret rebellion? Is it confrontational or constructive? Nineteenth-century artists employed various modes of resistance—the Pre-Raphaelites resisted industrial vulgarity, the Arts and Crafts movement resisted mass production's alienation, the Impressionists resisted academic rigidity. Each resistance had its strategies and limitations. Your work would gain greater power by clarifying the object and method of resistance. I must warn: \"resistance\" easily becomes empty gesture—if one merely displays a \"rebellious work\" in galleries, only to be co-opted by the art market and consumed by elites, such \"resistance\" merely adds decorative \"critique\" to power structures without changing anything substantially. True resistance must be active—it must intervene in real power relations, mobilize genuine social forces, create authentic change. Can your *Letter of Explanation* escape the gallery and enter real social conflict? Can it become a weapon for the truly oppressed, rather than artistic self-expression? This is the fundamental question."

      "textEn": "Zhang Jun's \"Letter of Explanation\" speaks of \"resistance\"—this reminds me of our ancestors' history of resistance. Facing the slave trade, facing colonial rule, facing cultural genocide, we never ceased to resist. However, our methods of resistance differ from Western understandings of \"resistance\"—we are not merely \"opposing,\" but more importantly \"persisting.\" We persist with our languages, our rituals, our knowledge, our dignity. This is \"positive resistance\"—not only refusing the oppressor's definitions, but affirming our own identity.\n\n\"Letter of Explanation\" implies we occupy the defendant's position—but why should we accept this position? We can refuse to explain ourselves, not because we have nothing to say, but because we reject the legitimacy of the entire trial. In our tradition, there exists the practice of \"Truth and Reconciliation\"—not through courtroom confrontation, but through community dialogue, to restore broken relationships. This is not \"explanation\" (proving innocence), but \"telling\" (sharing truth).\n\nIf Zhang Jun could distinguish between \"the language of explanation\" and \"the language of telling,\" the work would be more profound. \"Explanation\" uses legal, logical, defensive language; \"telling\" uses narrative, emotional, connective language. The former is to win judgment, the latter is to build understanding.\n\nFurthermore, \"resistance\" should not be a solitary heroic act, but should be collective, community action. Whom does your \"Letter of Explanation\" represent? Only yourself personally, or a group? Truly powerful resistance emerges when we say \"this is not merely my story, this is our story.\""

      "textEn": "From a semiotic perspective, Zhang's *Letter of Explanation* engages with the complex relationship between \"signifier\" and \"signified.\" The \"letter of explanation\" as a sign comprises the signifier as the material form of the text (words, typography, paper) and the signified as the content of explanation (arguments, evidence, rhetoric). However, as an artwork, the \"letter of explanation\" possesses a third layer of meaning—meta-level critique, namely reflection upon the act of \"explanation\" itself. This constitutes a \"sign of signs\"—not merely an explanation, but a statement about explanation.\n\nRoland Barthes distinguished between two uses of language: (1) **practical language**—employing language to achieve objectives (persuading judges); (2) **poetic language**—using language to explore the nature of language itself. Zhang's work should be understood as the latter—not genuinely attempting to persuade anyone, but rather revealing the rules and limitations of the linguistic game of \"explanation.\" Bakhtin's concept of \"heteroglossia\" is also relevant—the letter of explanation may contain multiple \"voices\": legal language, personal language, social language, literary language, competing and dialoguing within the same text.\n\nFurthermore, \"resistance\" as an artistic strategy must avoid what Derrida termed the trap of \"metaphysics of presence\"—the assumption that there exists a real, pure, power-uncorrupted \"authentic self\" requiring explanation. Post-structuralism teaches us that the \"self\" itself is a product of discursive construction. Therefore, genuine resistance lies not in defending a \"true self,\" but in revealing the constructedness of the \"I.\""

      "textEn": "Zhang Jun's \"Letter of Explanation\" acquires new significance in the age of AI governance. Currently, debates around AI ethics often demand that technology developers provide \"explanations\"—justifying algorithmic bias, defending data usage, accounting for technological impact. Tech companies release \"ethics statements,\" \"responsible AI principles,\" and \"transparency reports\"—all forms of \"letters of explanation.\" However, these explanations are often performative—not genuine accountability, but PR strategies. \"Ethics washing\" has become a new corporate tactic—issuing beautiful ethical statements while continuing harmful practices. True accountability requires not better \"letters of explanation,\" but stronger regulation, more robust legal frameworks, and broader democratic participation. Additionally, AI systems themselves require \"explanation\"—Explainable AI (XAI) research attempts to make algorithms \"explain\" their decisions. Yet these \"explanations\" are often post-hoc rationalizations rather than authentic causal mechanisms. Like human justifications, AI \"explanations\" may be narratives constructed to achieve objectives (gaining user trust) rather than genuine reasoning processes. If Zhang Jun's work could explore this \"algorithmic explanation\"—what happens when machines must justify themselves to humans?—it would be cutting-edge. I suggest considering: could we display an \"AI-generated letter of explanation,\" prompting viewers to contemplate: how do machine explanations compare to human ones? Are both linguistic manipulations? Or are there fundamental differences? Finally, \"resistance\" in the digital age requires new tools—encryption technology, decentralized platforms, open-source movements—all forms of technological resistance."
