      "textEn": "Observing Wang Jun's 'Project Chasing the Sun,' I cannot help but recall the allusion of Kuafu chasing the sun—Kuafu raced with the sun, entering the sun; thirsty, desiring drink, drank from River and Wei; River and Wei insufficient, went north to drink from great marsh. Not arrived, died of thirst on the road. This myth is tragic yet romantic; Kuafu knowing he couldn't catch the sun still pursued vigorously; this spirit of 'knowing it cannot be done yet doing it' is precisely human dignity's location. Does Wang Jun's 'chasing sun' also have this meaning? Or something else? The sun as natural phenomenon has since ancient times been important theme in art and philosophy—it symbolizes light, warmth, life, also symbolizes power, authority, constancy. 'Chasing sun' can have multiple interpretations: chasing light (enlightenment), chasing truth (knowledge), chasing ideals (struggle), even chasing illusion (delusion). If Wang Jun could display this multiplicity in the work, the meaning would be profound. The method of 'systematic observation and recording' considerably accords with scientific spirit, but I also remind: don't let systematicity overwhelm poetry. Data can be coldly precise, but art should be warmly moving. I suggest beyond systematic recording, also add personal experience—your fatigue, emotion, epiphany, disappointment during sun-chasing process; these subjective experiences are equally important as objective data. I once composed 'Red Cliff Ode,' having both rational description of astronomical phenomena and emotional expression of 'lodging ephemeral mayflies in heaven and earth, a grain in vast ocean'; combining both makes good work.",

      "textZh": "审《逐日计划》，其「时间性」与「运动性」的结合，颇类长卷山水之法。中国画长卷展现空间的同时，也展现时间——观者展开画卷的过程，就是时间流逝的过程。王君记录太阳运行，何尝不是一种「时间的画卷」？然以山水画法论之，「动态」的表现需讲究「节奏」与「韵律」。太阳东升西落，看似匀速，实则有微妙变化——晨曦的柔和、正午的强烈、黄昏的绚丽、夜幕的沉寂——这些阶段各有特质，应该在视觉上有所区分。建议可借鉴山水画的「四时」表现法——春之明媚、夏之苍翠、秋之清爽、冬之素净——将太阳的日周期与年周期结合，展现更丰富的时间层次。又，「逐日」不应只是「被动追踪」，更应该是「主动介入」——你的观察如何改变你对太阳的理解？你的记录如何改变你与自然的关系？这种「观者与对象的互动」，在山水画中体现为「卧游」——虽不出户，却能神游山水，这是一种精神的参与。王君的「逐日」若能达到这种境界——不仅记录太阳，更记录「你与太阳的关系」「你在追日过程中的变化」——则作品将更有深度。",
      "textEn": "Examining 'Project Chasing the Sun,' its combination of 'temporality' and 'mobility' rather resembles handscroll landscape methods. Chinese painting handscrolls display space while also displaying time—the viewer unrolling the scroll process is time's passage process. Wang Jun recording sun's movement, isn't this a kind of 'time's scroll'? Yet discussing through landscape painting methods, 'dynamic' expression requires 'rhythm' and 'meter.' Sun rising east setting west, seemingly uniform speed, actually has subtle changes—dawn's gentleness, noon's intensity, dusk's splendor, nightfall's silence—these stages each have characteristics, should be visually differentiated. I suggest referencing landscape painting's 'four seasons' expression method—spring's brightness, summer's verdancy, autumn's freshness, winter's plainness—combining sun's daily cycle with annual cycle, displaying richer temporal layers. Also, 'chasing sun' should not be only 'passive tracking' but 'active intervention'—how does your observation change your understanding of the sun? How does your recording change your relationship with nature? This 'viewer-object interaction,' in landscape painting embodies as 'reclining wandering'—though not leaving home, can spiritually wander landscapes; this is spiritual participation. If Wang Jun's 'chasing sun' could reach this realm—not only recording sun but recording 'your relationship with sun,' 'your changes during sun-chasing process'—the work will have more depth.",

      "textZh": "《逐日计划》让我想起透纳对光的痴迷。透纳一生追逐光——日出的光、日落的光、暴风雨中的光、迷雾中的光——他的许多作品都在探索光如何改变我们对世界的感知。然而，透纳的光不是科学的光，而是情感的光、精神的光。王君的「系统观察」若能达到透纳的境界——不仅记录太阳的物理轨迹，更捕捉光的精神意义——则作品价值非凡。然而，我必须追问：这种「追逐」的动机是什么？是科学研究？艺术探索？还是精神追求？不同动机决定了不同的方法与意义。如果是科学，那么精确性、系统性、可重复性是关键。如果是艺术，那么个人感受、审美判断、情感表达是核心。如果是精神追求，那么象征意义、哲学思考、存在体验是重点。王君需要明确自己的立场，否则作品会陷入「不科学也不艺术」的尴尬境地。此外，我还关注「人与自然周期的关系」——在工业时代之前，人类的生活完全依赖自然周期（日出而作、日落而息），但工业化、电气化打破了这种同步。今日的「逐日」，是否是一种「重新同步」的尝试？是在技术异化中寻回自然节奏？若能从这个角度展开，作品将有深刻的社会批判意义。",
      "textEn": "'Project Chasing the Sun' reminds me of Turner's obsession with light. Throughout his life Turner chased light—sunrise light, sunset light, storm light, mist light—many of his works explore how light transforms our perception of the world. However, Turner's light is not scientific light but emotional light, spiritual light. If Wang Jun's 'systematic observation' could reach Turner's realm—not only recording sun's physical trajectory but capturing light's spiritual meaning—the work's value would be extraordinary. However, I must ask: what is this 'chasing's' motivation? Scientific research? Artistic exploration? Or spiritual pursuit? Different motivations determine different methods and meanings. If science, then precision, systematicity, repeatability are key. If art, then personal feeling, aesthetic judgment, emotional expression are core. If spiritual pursuit, then symbolic meaning, philosophical thinking, existential experience are focal points. Wang Jun needs to clarify his position, otherwise the work will fall into the awkward situation of 'neither scientific nor artistic.' Furthermore, I'm also concerned with 'human-natural cycle relationship'—before the industrial age, human life completely depended on natural cycles (working at sunrise, resting at sunset), but industrialization, electrification broke this synchronization. Is today's 'chasing sun' an attempt at 'resynchronization'? Seeking natural rhythm amid technological alienation? If developed from this angle, the work will have profound social critical significance.",

      "textZh": "《逐日计划》让我想起我们的太阳崇拜传统。在许多非洲文化中，太阳不仅是自然现象，更是神灵、祖先、生命力的象征。我们的仪式常在日出或日落时举行，因为这些时刻是「界限时刻」——白昼与黑夜、生与死、人间与神界的交界。因此，「逐日」在我们文化中不是科学观察，而是精神朝圣。然而，我也看到了不同文化对太阳的不同态度。西方启蒙运动将太阳「祛魅」——它不再是神，而是一个可以计算、预测、解释的天体。这种科学化虽然带来了知识，但也带来了疏离——我们与太阳的关系从「敬畏」变成了「理解」，从「崇拜」变成了「利用」（太阳能）。王君的「逐日」处在哪个立场？是在延续启蒙的科学精神，还是在试图重新「赋魅」？我希望是后者——在这个过度理性、过度技术的时代，我们需要重新学会「敬畏」自然。然而，「敬畏」不是回到蒙昧，而是在知识的基础上建立新的尊重关系。我们可以理解太阳的核聚变原理，同时也感激它给予我们生命；我们可以计算太阳的轨道，同时也惊叹宇宙的奇妙。这种「知识与敬畏并存」的态度，正是我们这个时代最需要的。王君若能在作品中体现这种平衡，将非常有启发性。",
      "textEn": "'Project Chasing the Sun' reminds me of our sun worship tradition. In many African cultures, the sun is not merely natural phenomenon but symbol of deity, ancestors, life force. Our rituals often occur at sunrise or sunset because these moments are 'liminal moments'—boundaries between day and night, life and death, human world and divine realm. Therefore, 'chasing sun' in our culture is not scientific observation but spiritual pilgrimage. However, I also see different cultures' different attitudes toward the sun. Western Enlightenment 'disenchanted' the sun—it's no longer deity but a celestial body calculable, predictable, explicable. This scientification though bringing knowledge also brought alienation—our relationship with the sun changed from 'awe' to 'understanding,' from 'worship' to 'utilization' (solar energy). Where does Wang Jun's 'chasing sun' stand? Is it continuing Enlightenment's scientific spirit or attempting to 're-enchant'? I hope the latter—in this excessively rational, excessively technological era, we need to relearn 'awe' of nature. However, 'awe' is not returning to ignorance but establishing new respectful relationship based on knowledge. We can understand sun's nuclear fusion principles while also appreciating it giving us life; we can calculate sun's orbit while also marveling at universe's wonder. This attitude of 'knowledge and awe coexisting' is precisely what our era most needs. If Wang Jun could embody this balance in the work, it would be very enlightening.",

      "textZh": "《逐日计划》作为时间性项目（time-based project），其叙事结构值得从形式主义角度分析。巴赫金提出的「时空体」（chronotope）理论在此很有启发——不同的时空结构产生不同的叙事模式。「逐日」的时空体是「循环时空体」——太阳东升西落，日复一日，这是永恒重复的循环。然而，循环中也有变化——四季的更替、天气的变化、观察者的成长——这种「重复中的差异」正是时间性艺术的魅力。什克洛夫斯基区分「故事时间」（story time）与「话语时间」（discourse time）——「故事时间」是事件实际发生的时间（太阳的运行），「话语时间」是叙述这些事件所用的时间（作品的呈现）。王君若能在两者之间制造「错位」——例如用一分钟的视频浓缩一整天的太阳运行，或用一小时的装置展现日出的瞬间——将产生有趣的时间感知效果。俄国形式主义还强调「陌生化」——如何让日常的、自动化的感知变得陌生？太阳的升落已经「自动化」——我们每天看到却不再真正「看见」。王君的系统观察，恰恰是对这种自动化的打破——通过刻意的、持续的关注，让我们重新「看见」太阳。然而，仅有陌生化还不够，还需要「再陌生化」（re-defamiliarization）——当观察本身也变得常规时，需要新的方法打破它。建议引入「意外性」——例如在预期的太阳轨迹中加入人为干预、视角突变、叙事中断，让观者始终保持警觉与好奇。",
      "textEn": "'Project Chasing the Sun' as time-based project, its narrative structure merits analysis from a formalist perspective. Bakhtin's proposed 'chronotope' theory is very enlightening here—different spatiotemporal structures produce different narrative modes. 'Chasing sun's' chronotope is 'cyclical chronotope'—sun rising east setting west, day after day, this is eternally repeating cycle. However, within cycles there are also changes—seasons' alternation, weather's变化, observer's growth—this 'difference within repetition' is precisely time-based art's charm. Shklovsky distinguished 'story time' and 'discourse time'—'story time' is events' actual occurrence time (sun's movement), 'discourse time' is time used to narrate these events (work's presentation). If Wang Jun could create 'dislocation' between the two—for instance using one-minute video to condense an entire day's sun movement, or using one-hour installation to display sunrise's instant—it would produce interesting temporal perception effects. Russian Formalism also emphasizes 'defamiliarization'—how to make daily, automatized perception strange? Sun's rising and setting have already been 'automatized'—we see it daily yet no longer truly 'see.' Wang Jun's systematic observation is precisely breaking this automatization—through deliberate, sustained attention, making us re-'see' the sun. However, defamiliarization alone is insufficient; 're-defamiliarization' is also needed—when observation itself becomes routine, new methods are needed to break it. I suggest introducing 'unexpectedness'—for instance in expected sun trajectory adding human intervention, perspective mutation, narrative interruption, keeping viewers always alert and curious.",

      "textZh": "《逐日计划》在AI时代引发关于「算法化时间」的思考。在智能手机、智能手表、智能家居的包围中，我们的时间感知已经被算法深刻改变。手机会提醒你日出日落时间、最佳拍照时机、紫外线强度，这些信息虽然便利，却也在不知不觉中剥夺了我们「直接感知自然」的能力——我们不再需要观察天空就能知道天气，不再需要感受温度就能决定穿着。这种「去经验化」（de-experientialization）是数字时代的一大危机。王君的「系统观察」若能成为对这种危机的抵抗——通过持续的、亲身的观察，重新建立人与自然的直接联系——将非常有价值。然而，我也担心：这种观察是否也会被技术化？你会用什么工具记录太阳？相机？GPS？时间戳？这些技术工具不可避免地会「中介」你的经验——你看到的不再是「太阳」，而是「屏幕上的太阳」「数据中的太阳」「坐标系中的太阳」。更激进的问题是：在未来，AI是否可以替代我们「追逐太阳」？它可以24小时不间断观察、可以同时观察全球各地的日出日落、可以生成比人眼更精确的太阳轨迹图。如果AI能做得更好，人类的「逐日」还有意义吗？我的答案是：有，因为意义不在于结果（数据、图像），而在于过程（体验、感悟）。王君的作品若能强调这一点——不是追逐数据，而是追逐体验——将为我们保留一片「非算法化」的人性空间。",
      "textEn": "'Project Chasing the Sun' provokes reflection on 'algorithmicized time' in the AI era. Surrounded by smartphones, smartwatches, smart homes, our temporal perception has been profoundly altered by algorithms. Phones remind you of sunrise sunset times, best photography moments, UV intensity; this information though convenient also unknowingly deprives our ability to 'directly perceive nature'—we no longer need to observe sky to know weather, no longer need to feel temperature to decide clothing. This 'de-experientialization' is a major crisis in the digital age. If Wang Jun's 'systematic observation' could become resistance to this crisis—through sustained, personal observation, re-establishing human-nature direct connection—it would be very valuable. However, I also worry: will this observation also be technologized? What tools will you use to record the sun? Camera? GPS? Timestamp? These technical tools inevitably will 'mediate' your experience—what you see is no longer 'the sun' but 'sun on screen,' 'sun in data,' 'sun in coordinate system.' The more radical question is: in the future, can AI replace us in 'chasing the sun'? It can observe 24 hours uninterrupted, can simultaneously observe sunrises and sunsets globally, can generate more precise sun trajectory maps than human eyes. If AI can do better, does human 'chasing sun' still have meaning? My answer is: yes, because meaning lies not in results (data, images) but in process (experience, realization). If Wang Jun's work could emphasize this point—not chasing data but chasing experience—it will preserve for us a space of 'non-algorithmicized' humanity.",
