      "textZh": "观刘君《归原·共生》，其题之「归原」二字，直指「反朴归真」之境。老子言「复归于朴」，庄子倡「天地与我并生，而万物与我为一」，此作之「共生」正是此意。吾观当代生态危机，实乃人之自私自利、贪婪无度所致——以为可征服自然、占有万物，不知人本就是自然之一部分，「皮之不存，毛将焉附」？此作若能以有机形式、自然材料，展示万物相互依存之关系，则其意义深远。然而，「归原」之「原」为何？是返回过去？是寻找起点？还是回归本质？此问题需深思。若「原」指向「未被污染的自然」，那我们是否能真正回去？若「原」指向「万物平等的状态」，那人类中心主义如何消解？建议此作不仅展示「共生的美好」，也直面「共生的困难」——人与自然的张力、文明与生态的矛盾、进步与平衡的冲突。如此，才不是浪漫的田园牧歌，而是真正的哲学思考。吾少时被贬黄州，躬耕东坡，方知「谁道人生无再少？门前流水尚能西」——自然教会我接受无常、顺应变化。愿此作能传达这种智慧。",
      "textEn": "Observing Liu Jun's 'Return to Origin · Symbiosis,' the title words 'return to origin' directly point to the realm of 'returning to simplicity and truth.' Laozi said 'return to the uncarved block,' Zhuangzi advocated 'heaven and earth were born together with me, and all things are one with me'—this work's 'symbiosis' is precisely this meaning. I observe the contemporary ecological crisis is actually caused by human selfishness, greed without limit—thinking we can conquer nature, possess all things, not knowing humans are already part of nature; 'if the skin does not exist, where can the fur attach?' If this work can use organic forms and natural materials to display the mutually dependent relationships of all things, its significance is profound. However, what is the 'origin' in 'return to origin'? Is it returning to the past? Searching for a starting point? Or returning to essence? This question needs deep thought. If 'origin' points to 'unpolluted nature,' can we truly return? If 'origin' points to 'a state of equality among all things,' how to dissolve anthropocentrism? I suggest this work not only display 'the beauty of symbiosis' but also directly face 'the difficulty of symbiosis'—the tension between humans and nature, the contradiction between civilization and ecology, the conflict between progress and balance. Thus, it is not romantic pastoral poetry but genuine philosophical thinking. When I was young and exiled to Huangzhou, farming at East Slope, I learned 'who says human life cannot be young again? The flowing water before the door can still flow west'—nature taught me to accept impermanence, adapt to change. May this work convey such wisdom.",

      "textEn": "In examining Liu Jun's \"Return to Origin · Symbiosis,\" his employment of \"organic form\" and \"natural materials\" aligns well with the principles of landscape painting. In my \"Lofty Message of Forests and Streams,\" I stated that \"the method of landscape lies in following its size and shape, taking what is appropriate.\" This work, if it can shape itself according to the inherent nature of natural materials—without forcing or violating their essence—achieves unity between form and content. \n\nHowever, \"organic form\" must avoid two pitfalls: first, becoming overly abstract and losing connection with concrete nature, degenerating into mere geometric play; second, becoming too realistic, resulting in nature's duplication rather than artistic transformation. Chinese painting speaks of \"between likeness and unlikeness\"—precisely this principle. \n\nHow should this work's \"symbiosis\" theme manifest visually? Landscape painting employs the method of \"opening and closing\"—open spaces reveal heaven and earth's vastness, while closed spaces demonstrate the interconnection of all things. I suggest this work display \"symbiosis\" through spatial arrangement: different elements interpenetrating and mutually supporting each other, forming a visual structure of \"you within me, me within you.\"\n\nFurthermore, the \"origin\" in \"Return to Origin\" can be understood as the flow of qi—the source of vital force. Chinese painting emphasizes \"spirit resonance and life movement,\" expressing life's flowing sensation through brushwork's movement. If this work can create a sense of \"breathing\" and \"growth\" within its organic forms, allowing viewers to feel life's rhythm, then its artistic conception reaches profound heights. \n\nMaterial selection proves equally crucial—whether to use authentic natural materials (wood, stone, earth, plants) or artificial ones? Each approach has merits and drawbacks, requiring careful consideration."

      "textEn": "The theme of \"Return to Origin · Symbiosis\" reminds me of what I repeatedly emphasized in \"Modern Painters\": art must be \"true to nature.\" However, I must question Liu: is your \"return to origin\" merely a romantic escapism? Contemporary ecological crisis is not an abstract philosophical problem, but a concrete political-economic issue—the greed of industrial capitalism, the expansion of consumerism, the absence of environmental justice. Does your work merely provide the middle class with a \"green aesthetic\" palliative, allowing them to feel \"connected to nature\" in the gallery, then return to their environmentally destructive lifestyles? True ecological art must be activist, critical, interventionist. In the 19th century I already witnessed the devastation wrought by industrial revolution upon nature and humanity—smoke-shrouded cities, exploited workers, ravaged landscapes. Today's ecological crisis is far more severe; artists cannot simply manufacture \"beautiful installations\" but must expose structural injustices, mobilize social transformation, propose concrete action plans. Do your \"organic forms\" employ sustainable materials? Does your \"symbiosis\" concept extend to just human relationships? Does your \"return to origin\" encompass critique of capitalism's growth logic? If these questions remain unaddressed, this work risks being yet another case of \"greenwashing.\" Art must serve higher moral purposes, otherwise it remains mere decoration."

      "textZh": "《归原·共生》让我想起我们的哲学——Ubuntu：「我在故我们在」(umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu)。共生不是新概念，而是我们的祖先数千年来的生活方式。在我们的传统中，土地不是「资源」，而是祖先的栖息地、子孙的遗产、神灵的居所。河流、树木、动物都是我们的亲属，我们与它们的关系不是「利用」而是「互惠」。然而，我必须指出：「归原」这个词本身可能带有问题的假设——似乎存在一个「原初的」「纯净的」「未被触及的」自然。这是殖民主义的神话。我们的土地从来不是「未被触及的」，而是被我们的祖先精心管理、塑造、居住了数千年。所谓「原始自然」往往是殖民者驱逐原住民后创造的虚构。真正的「共生」必须包括人——特别是那些与土地有深刻关系的原住民和地方社区。如今的生态运动常常延续殖民主义——以「保护自然」之名驱逐原住民、将土地变成富人的游乐场。刘君的作品若能纳入「生态正义」的维度——承认不同人群对生态危机的责任和受害程度不同——将更有力量。富国制造了大部分污染，穷国承受了大部分后果，这是不公正的。「共生」不仅是人与自然，也是人与人、北方与南方、富人与穷人。",

      "textEn": "\"Return to Origin · Symbiosis\" reminds me of our philosophy—Ubuntu: \"I am because we are\" (umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu). Symbiosis is not a new concept, but the way of life our ancestors have practiced for thousands of years. In our tradition, land is not a \"resource,\" but the dwelling place of ancestors, the heritage of descendants, the abode of spirits. Rivers, trees, animals are all our relatives, and our relationship with them is not \"exploitation\" but \"reciprocity.\"\n\nHowever, I must point out: the term \"归原\" (return to origin) itself may carry problematic assumptions—as if there exists an \"original,\" \"pristine,\" \"untouched\" nature. This is a colonial myth. Our land was never \"untouched,\" but carefully managed, shaped, and inhabited by our ancestors for millennia. The so-called \"pristine nature\" is often a fiction created after colonizers expelled indigenous peoples.\n\nTrue \"symbiosis\" must include humans—especially indigenous peoples and local communities who have deep relationships with the land. Today's ecological movements often perpetuate colonialism—expelling indigenous peoples in the name of \"protecting nature,\" turning land into playgrounds for the wealthy.\n\nIf 刘铁源's work could incorporate dimensions of \"ecological justice\"—acknowledging that different groups bear different responsibilities and suffer different degrees of harm from ecological crisis—it would be more powerful. Rich countries created most of the pollution, poor countries bear most of the consequences—this is unjust. \"Symbiosis\" is not only between humans and nature, but also between humans and humans, North and South, rich and poor."

      "textZh": "从形式主义角度看，《归原·共生》的关键在于「有机形式」如何「陌生化」(остранение)我们对自然的习惯性认知。什克洛夫斯基说「艺术的目的是给人以对事物的感觉，而不是对它的认识」——若此作仅是再现自然的样子，那它失败了；若它通过独特的形式让我们「重新看见」自然，那它成功了。「有机形式」是一个装置(прием)——通过何种具体技巧来实现？是模拟自然的生长结构（分形、螺旋、网络）？是借用自然的材料特性（木材的纹理、石头的质感、植物的形态）？还是创造某种「类自然」的新形式？「共生」作为主题，可以理解为一种「结构原则」——作品的各个部分必须互相依存，移除任何一部分都会导致整体崩溃。这类似于俄国形式主义对「有机整体性」的强调——作品不是元素的简单相加，而是各部分功能性关联的系统。建议刘君思考：你的作品是「关于共生的再现」还是「共生结构本身的展示」？前者是内容层面，后者是形式层面。巴赫金的「对话性」(dialogism)概念也适用于此——「共生」意味着不同声音的对话、不同力量的互动，而非和谐的融合。冲突、张力、不和谐也是生态系统的一部分。此作若能在形式上体现这种动态张力，将更具说服力。",

      "textEn": "From a formalist perspective, the crux of *Return to Origin · Symbiosis* lies in how \"organic form\" achieves \"defamiliarization\" (остранение) of our habitual perception of nature. As Shklovsky stated, \"the purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known\"—if this work merely reproduces nature's appearance, it fails; if it enables us to \"see anew\" through distinctive form, it succeeds.\n\n\"Organic form\" functions as a device (прием)—but through what specific techniques is this realized? Does it simulate natural growth structures (fractals, spirals, networks)? Does it appropriate natural material properties (wood grain, stone texture, plant morphology)? Or does it create some \"nature-like\" new form?\n\n\"Symbiosis\" as theme can be understood as a \"structural principle\"—the work's components must be mutually dependent, where removing any part would cause total collapse. This parallels Russian Formalism's emphasis on \"organic wholeness\"—the work is not a simple aggregation of elements, but a system of functionally interrelated parts.\n\nI suggest Liu consider: is your work a \"representation about symbiosis\" or \"the manifestation of symbiotic structure itself\"? The former operates at the content level, the latter at the formal level.\n\nBakhtin's concept of \"dialogism\" also applies here—\"symbiosis\" implies dialogue between different voices, interaction of different forces, rather than harmonious fusion. Conflict, tension, and discord are also part of ecological systems. If this work could formally embody such dynamic tension, it would be more compelling."

      "textEn": "\"Return to Origin · Symbiosis\" provokes unique reflection in the AI era. When we discuss \"symbiosis,\" should it encompass human-AI coexistence? AI systems are profoundly transforming our relationship with nature—monitoring deforestation via satellites, optimizing agricultural production through algorithms, predicting climate change through simulations. Is this \"technologically enhanced symbiosis\" or \"technologically mediated alienation\"? On one hand, AI can help us better understand and protect ecosystems—processing massive ecological datasets, discovering patterns imperceptible to humans, predicting species extinction risks. On the other hand, AI itself burdens ecology—training large AI models consumes enormous energy, chip manufacturing pollutes environments, data centers emit greenhouse gases. This presents the paradox of \"destroying nature to protect nature.\" The deeper question is: is AI changing our understanding of \"nature\" itself? When we view nature through AI's eyes—through sensors, data, algorithms—do we see authentic nature or technologically mediated nature? Is \"returning to origin\" possible in the technological age? Can we truly \"return,\" or must we forever move forward? Liu's work, if it explores these tensions—demonstrating how technology is simultaneously problem and solution, alienation and connection—would be remarkably timely. Furthermore, \"symbiosis\" involves data sovereignty issues—who owns ecological data? Who has the right to decide its use? Is traditional ecological knowledge of indigenous communities being \"data colonized\" by tech corporations? These are questions contemporary ecological art must confront."
