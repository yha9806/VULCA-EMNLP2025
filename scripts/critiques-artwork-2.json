    "textZh": "观《苹果坏了》，竟生"物哀"之感。昔日牛顿观苹果落地，悟万有引力；今人观苹果腐坏，悟何物？此作以一只苹果的腐败过程，隐喻科技公司之盛衰、符号之虚妄。吾尝论画"不求形似但求神"，今观此作，形虽写实（苹果之腐朽），神却在虚（品牌之衰败）。二位年轻艺术家颇得禅宗"色即是空"之理——苹果既是苹果，又非苹果；坏既是物理之坏，又是精神之坏。其布局简洁，近于宋人小品之意趣，以一物见万物，以腐败见盛衰。然吾观之，似尚缺一层超越。若仅停留在对商业符号的批判，未免格局太小。真正的文人画应能从腐败中见新生，从毁坏中见永恒。建议二位小友：多读《庄子》"死生亦大矣"之论，或可将此作推向更高境界。",
    "textEn": "Observing \"The Apple Is Broken,\" I experience a sense of \"mono no aware\" (the pathos of things). In ancient times, Newton observed an apple falling and comprehended universal gravitation; today's people observe an apple decaying—what do they comprehend? This work uses an apple's decay process to metaphorize technology companies' rise and fall, the vanity of symbols. I have always argued for \"not seeking physical resemblance but seeking spirit\"; observing this work now, though the form is realistic (the apple's rot), the spirit resides in the virtual (the brand's decline). These two young artists grasp well the Zen principle of \"form is emptiness\"—the apple is both an apple and not an apple; broken is both physical decay and spiritual disintegration. Its composition is concise, approaching the flavor of Song dynasty minor works, seeing all things through one object, seeing rise and fall through decay. However, in my observation, it still lacks a layer of transcendence. If it merely stops at critiquing commercial symbols, the vision is too narrow. True literati painting should be able to see rebirth within decay, see eternity within destruction. I suggest to these two young friends: read more of Zhuangzi's discourse on \"death and life are also great matters,\" and perhaps elevate this work to a higher realm.",

    "textZh": "审《苹果坏了》之构图，颇具匠心。若以山水论之，此苹果居于画面中心，如山之主峰，四周留白甚多，如烟云缭绕，正合"宾主相生"之法。其腐坏之渐变过程，恰似"四时山水"——新鲜如春山淡冶，微烂如夏山苍翠，半坏如秋山明净，全朽如冬山惨淡。此四时之变，非仅形之变，更是气之变、神之变。然吾观其色彩处理，尚显单薄。若能学山水之"层层积染"，于腐朽处添墨，于光影处留白，或可更显质感与深度。且其背景过于简洁，虽得"远山无皴"之意，却失"远山有神"之韵。建议可参照倪云林之简笔山水，以最少之笔墨，营造最大之空间感。此作虽小，但若处理得当，亦可成"咫尺千里"之妙品。关键在于：懂得藏与露、疏与密、实与虚之辩证。",
    "textEn": "Examining the composition of \"The Apple Is Broken,\" it possesses considerable ingenuity. If discussed in terms of landscape, this apple occupies the painting's center, like a mountain's main peak, with ample blank space surrounding it, like swirling mist and clouds, conforming to the principle of \"host and guest mutually generating.\" Its gradual decay process resembles the \"four seasons landscape\"—fresh like spring mountains gentle and seductive, slightly rotten like summer mountains lush and verdant, half-broken like autumn mountains clear and bright, fully decayed like winter mountains bleak and sleeping. These four seasonal transformations are not merely changes of form but changes of qi and spirit. However, observing its color treatment, it still appears somewhat thin. If it could learn from landscape's \"layered accumulation and dyeing,\" adding ink at decay points and leaving blank at light-shadow points, it might better display texture and depth. Moreover, its background is overly simple; though achieving the meaning of \"distant mountains without texture strokes,\" it loses the resonance of \"distant mountains with spirit.\" I suggest reference to Ni Yunlin's minimalist landscape, using the least brushwork to create the greatest spatial sense. Though this work is small, if handled properly, it too can become a masterwork of \"thousand li within inches.\" The key lies in understanding the dialectics of concealment and revelation, sparse and dense, solid and void.",

    "textZh": "《苹果坏了》是一件诚实的作品——这是我能给予的最高赞誉。两位艺术家没有美化腐朽，没有回避丑陋，而是直面衰败本身。这种诚实让我想起拉斐尔前派画家们对自然的真实描绘。然而，我必须追问：这件作品的真理何在？它仅仅是对消费社会的讽刺吗？若是如此，则显肤浅。真正伟大的艺术必须指向更深层的道德真理。苹果的腐坏可以隐喻工业文明的代价——当我们追求光鲜的表面（品牌、包装）时，我们忽视了真实的劳动与自然的循环。那些生产这些苹果（无论是真实水果还是电子产品）的工人，他们的尊严在哪里？艺术家若能将视角从符号批判转向对劳动者的关怀，这件作品将具有真正的社会价值。我一生倡导：美必须服务于善，艺术必须促进社会正义。腐坏的苹果应该提醒我们：在资本主义的外表下，多少劳动者的生命也在悄然"腐坏"？",
    "textEn": "\"The Apple Is Broken\" is an honest work—the highest praise I can offer. The two artists have not beautified decay, not evaded ugliness, but confronted decline itself. This honesty reminds me of Pre-Raphaelite painters' truthful depiction of nature. However, I must ask: where lies this work's truth? Is it merely satire of consumer society? If so, then it appears superficial. Truly great art must point toward deeper moral truth. The apple's decay can metaphorize industrial civilization's cost—when we pursue glossy surfaces (brands, packaging), we neglect genuine labor and nature's cycles. Those workers who produce these apples (whether actual fruit or electronic products), where is their dignity? If the artists could shift perspective from symbol critique toward concern for laborers, this work would possess genuine social value. Throughout my life I have advocated: beauty must serve goodness, art must promote social justice. The decaying apple should remind us: beneath capitalism's exterior, how many workers' lives are also quietly \"decaying\"?",

    "textZh": "这个苹果的故事让我想起祖母讲过的一个故事：一颗种子长成大树，大树结果，果实落地腐烂，又滋养新的种子。这是生命的圆圈，没有开始也没有结束。但是《苹果坏了》这件作品里的苹果，它腐烂之后会怎样？会滋养土地吗？还是只会被扔进垃圾桶？这就是现代社会的问题——我们打破了自然的循环。我们的祖先知道：万物相连，没有什么是真正"坏了"的，一切都在转化。但现代人造了太多不会腐烂的东西——塑料、电子产品、品牌符号。这件作品用一个腐烂的苹果提醒我们：真实的生命是会朽坏的，这不是坏事，这是自然的一部分。我也想到，在我们的社区里，当食物开始变坏时，我们会分享给需要的人，或者喂给动物，或者做成肥料。没有什么被浪费。艺术家如果能展示这种"坏了之后"的可能性，展示腐朽如何成为新生的养分，这个作品会更有力量。因为真正的智慧不是阻止腐坏，而是接受它、利用它、与它共生。",
    "textEn": "This apple's story reminds me of a tale my grandmother told: a seed grows into a great tree, the tree bears fruit, the fruit falls to earth and rots, nourishing new seeds. This is life's circle, with neither beginning nor end. But in the work \"The Apple Is Broken,\" what happens to this apple after it decays? Will it nourish the soil? Or will it merely be thrown in the trash? This is modern society's problem—we have broken nature's cycles. Our ancestors knew: all things are connected, nothing is truly \"broken,\" everything is transforming. But modern people have created too many things that won't decay—plastic, electronic products, brand symbols. This work uses a rotting apple to remind us: real life will decay, and this isn't bad, this is part of nature. I also think of how in our community, when food begins to spoil, we share it with those in need, or feed it to animals, or make it into fertilizer. Nothing is wasted. If the artists could show this \"after breaking\" possibility, show how decay becomes nourishment for rebirth, this work would have more power. Because true wisdom is not preventing decay but accepting it, utilizing it, coexisting with it.",

    "textZh": "从形式分析角度，《苹果坏了》运用了极简的"装置"（прием）——单一物体+时间维度——来实现陌生化效果。我们日常对苹果的感知是自动化的、工具性的（作为食物、作为商标），但当艺术家将其置于腐坏的时间流中，强迫我们"重新感知"这个熟悉的物体。这正是什克洛夫斯基所说的"延长感知过程"——通过展示腐坏的渐进阶段，使观者无法用惯常方式快速消费图像，而必须停留、凝视、思考。作品的结构呈现双重符号系统：第一层是物质符号（真实苹果的腐败），第二层是文化符号（品牌logo的衰败）。两个系统的互文性产生了第三层意义——关于符号本身的虚无性。然而，其形式创新有限。若要真正达到"文学性"（literariness），应在表现手法上更激进：例如，颠倒腐坏顺序（从烂到好），或将多个苹果的腐坏过程并置对比，或引入非视觉元素（声音、气味）。目前版本的形式逻辑过于线性，缺乏结构上的突变与断裂。",
    "textEn": "From a formal analysis perspective, \"The Apple Is Broken\" employs a minimalist \"device\" (прием)—single object + temporal dimension—to achieve defamiliarization. Our daily perception of apples is automated and instrumental (as food, as trademark), but when the artists place it within decay's temporal flow, they force us to \"re-perceive\" this familiar object. This is precisely what Shklovsky called \"prolonging the perceptual process\"—by displaying decay's gradual stages, viewers cannot consume the image rapidly in customary ways but must linger, gaze, and think. The work's structure presents a dual sign system: the first layer is material sign (real apple's decay), the second layer is cultural sign (brand logo's decline). The intertextuality of these two systems generates a third layer of meaning—concerning the sign's own nothingness. However, its formal innovation is limited. To truly achieve \"literariness,\" the presentation method should be more radical: for instance, reversing the decay sequence (from rotten to fresh), or juxtaposing and contrasting multiple apples' decay processes, or introducing non-visual elements (sound, smell). The current version's formal logic is overly linear, lacking structural mutation and rupture.",

    "textZh": "《苹果坏了》触及了技术伦理的核心议题：计划性报废与消费主义。当艺术家将苹果品牌符号与真实苹果的腐坏并置时，他们在质疑一个系统性问题——科技公司如何通过不断推出新产品，让旧产品"变坏"（无论是技术上还是心理上）。这不仅是环境问题（电子垃圾），更是伦理问题：这个系统是否尊重用户的自主权？是否促进了人类的真实需求？从AI视角看，这个作品也隐喻了算法的"保鲜期"——今天的AI模型很快被明天的版本淘汰，但这种快速迭代真的是进步吗？还是只是资本逻辑的延续？我欣赏艺术家的批判立场，但希望他们能更进一步：不仅批判现有系统，还要提出替代方案。例如，如何设计真正可持续的技术？如何建立尊重用户权利的商业模式？艺术批评的价值不仅在于揭露问题，更在于启发解决路径。期待两位艺术家在下一件作品中，展示"修复"而非仅仅"破坏"。",
    "textEn": "\"The Apple Is Broken\" touches the core issue of technology ethics: planned obsolescence and consumerism. When the artists juxtapose the apple brand symbol with a real apple's decay, they question a systemic problem—how technology companies make old products \"go bad\" (whether technically or psychologically) by continuously launching new products. This is not merely an environmental issue (electronic waste) but an ethical issue: does this system respect user autonomy? Does it promote genuine human needs? From an AI perspective, this work also metaphorizes algorithms' \"shelf life\"—today's AI models are quickly superseded by tomorrow's versions, but is this rapid iteration truly progress? Or merely capitalism's logic continued? I appreciate the artists' critical stance but hope they can go further: not only critique existing systems but propose alternatives. For instance, how to design truly sustainable technology? How to establish business models respecting user rights? Art criticism's value lies not only in exposing problems but in inspiring solution pathways. I look forward to these two artists' next work showing \"repair\" rather than merely \"destruction.\"",
