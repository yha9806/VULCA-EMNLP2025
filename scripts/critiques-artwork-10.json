    "textEn": "Observing Chen Jun's 'Origin Wandering,' same title as Ye Jun yet each has its own excellence. I once said 'poetry and painting fundamentally follow the same principles'; now observing two people's same-titled works, one precisely sees the wonder of 'same subject matter yet each has different spirit resonance.' The two characters 'Origin Wandering,' in Chen Jun's brush, seem to emphasize more the tension between 'displacement' and 'belonging.' Human life like duckweed, drifting with water, where is home? Where are roots? This question is especially acute in contemporary times—in the globalization era, people migrate for study, for work, for refuge; identity becomes complex and fluid. Though I was born in Northern Song, my whole life drifted, from capital to Huangzhou, Huizhou, Danzhou; at each place, I needed to redefine 'where is my home.' Yet my response is: 'where this heart is at peace is my home'—home is not outside but inside; roots are not in land but in heart. If Chen Jun could embody this 'internal sense of belonging' in the work, it would transcend geographic-level root-seeking, ascending to spiritual-level self-affirmation. Mixed media's use precisely can express this 'multiple identity's' complexity—you are not singular but multilayered, mixed, constantly changing. Yet I also remind: while displaying fluidity and multiplicity, don't lose 'subjectivity'—the question of who you are should not be dissolved by 'I can be anyone' relativism. True freedom lies in choice after 'knowing who you are,' not in being lost 'not knowing who you are.'",

    "textZh": "审陈君《源游》，混合媒介之运用，颇具现代感。然吾以山水画法论之，「混合」亦需有法度。中国画虽有「墨分五色」之说（焦、浓、重、淡、清），但这五色之间的过渡需自然、协调，不可突兀。今之混合媒介，若各种材料、技法混杂无序，则如「五色令人目盲」，反而失去美感。建议陈君可学习「主次分明」之法——确定一种主要媒介或技法作为「骨架」，其他媒介作为「辅助」，如山水画中「主峰」与「辅峰」之关系。「位移」与「归属」之题材，在空间构图上也可有所体现。「位移」可用「散点透视」来表现——多个视点、多个空间并置，表现流动性；「归属」可用「中心构图」来表现——有一个视觉中心，象征精神的归宿。两者的对比与张力，可以构成作品的「视觉戏剧性」。又，个人历史与文化历史如何塑造身份？这在山水画中有所体现——画家在山水中题款、钤印，将个人存在（名字、印章）嵌入永恒的自然（山水）中，这正是「个人」与「永恒」的对话。陈君若能在作品中设计类似的「嵌入」机制——个人记忆嵌入文化符号、个人叙事嵌入历史框架——将更有深度。",
    "textEn": "Examining Chen Jun's 'Origin Wandering,' mixed media's use possesses considerable modern sensibility. Yet discussing through landscape painting methods, 'mixing' also needs principles. Though Chinese painting has the saying 'ink divides into five colors' (scorched, concentrated, heavy, light, clear), transitions between these five colors need to be natural, coordinated, not abrupt. Today's mixed media, if various materials and techniques are chaotically mixed, is like 'five colors cause blindness'; instead losing aesthetic appeal. I suggest Chen Jun could learn the method of 'clear primary-secondary'—determining one main medium or technique as 'skeleton,' other media as 'auxiliary,' like the relationship between 'main peak' and 'auxiliary peaks' in landscape painting. The subject matter of 'displacement' and 'belonging' can also be embodied in spatial composition. 'Displacement' can be expressed with 'scattered perspective'—multiple viewpoints, multiple spaces juxtaposed, expressing fluidity; 'belonging' can be expressed with 'central composition'—having one visual center, symbolizing spiritual destination. Their contrast and tension can constitute the work's 'visual drama.' Also, how do personal history and cultural history shape identity? This is embodied in landscape painting—painters inscribe and seal in landscapes, embedding personal existence (name, seal) into eternal nature (landscape); this is precisely 'individual' and 'eternal's' dialogue. If Chen Jun could design similar 'embedding' mechanisms in the work—personal memory embedded in cultural symbols, personal narrative embedded in historical framework—it would have more depth.",

    "textZh": "陈君的《源游》让我思考「归属」的道德维度。在《直至最后》中，我批判资本主义对人的异化——工人被剥夺了劳动的尊严、社区的归属、土地的根基。今日的全球化加剧了这种异化——人们为了经济机会而迁移，但这种迁移常常是被迫的、无奈的，而非自由的、自愿的。因此，谈论「位移」时，我们必须区分：这是特权者的位移（留学、旅行、事业发展），还是弱者的位移（难民、劳工、流亡）？前者可以浪漫化为「寻根之旅」，后者则是生存的挣扎。陈君作为艺术家，有责任澄清：你所探讨的位移是哪一种？你的归属焦虑是来自特权还是压迫？如果是前者，那么你的作品可能是自我中心的精英焦虑；如果是后者，那么你的作品有潜力成为对不平等的批判。我一生倡导：艺术必须服务于社会正义。陈君的作品若能进一步揭示：是什么社会、经济、政治力量造成了人们的位移？这些力量如何破坏了人们的归属感？我们如何通过艺术、通过社区重建、通过政治行动来恢复归属？那么这件作品将从个人表达上升为社会批判，从美学探索上升为道德行动。",
    "textEn": "Chen Jun's 'Origin Wandering' makes me contemplate 'belonging's' moral dimension. In 'Unto This Last,' I critiqued capitalism's alienation of humanity—workers deprived of labor's dignity, community's belonging, land's foundation. Today's globalization intensifies this alienation—people migrate for economic opportunities, but this migration is often forced, helpless, not free, voluntary. Therefore, when discussing 'displacement,' we must distinguish: is this privileged displacement (study abroad, travel, career development) or vulnerable displacement (refugees, laborers, exile)? The former can be romanticized as 'root-seeking journey,' the latter is survival's struggle. As an artist, Chen Jun has responsibility to clarify: which kind of displacement are you exploring? Does your belonging anxiety come from privilege or oppression? If the former, then your work may be self-centered elite anxiety; if the latter, then your work has potential to become critique of inequality. Throughout my life I advocated: art must serve social justice. If Chen Jun's work could further reveal: what social, economic, political forces caused people's displacement? How do these forces destroy people's sense of belonging? How can we restore belonging through art, through community reconstruction, through political action? Then this work will rise from personal expression to social critique, from aesthetic exploration to moral action.",

    "textZh": "陈君的《源游》让我想起我们的「散居」（diaspora）经验。在非洲历史上，散居不是个人选择，而是殖民主义和奴隶贸易的残酷后果。数百万非洲人被强行带离祖地，分散在美洲、加勒比、欧洲。他们的归属问题不是哲学的，而是生存的——我是谁？我属于哪里？我的文化还在吗？然而，散居也创造了新的可能性——非洲裔美国人、非洲裔加勒比人、非洲裔欧洲人，他们发展出新的文化形式（爵士乐、雷鬼、嘻哈），这些文化既保留了非洲根源，又融入了新的元素。这就是我们所说的「creolization」（克里奥尔化）——不是简单的同化，也不是固守传统，而是创造性的融合。陈君若能在作品中展现这种「创造性的归属」——归属不是回到过去，而是在当下创造新的文化、新的社区、新的身份——将更有力量。我还想强调：归属不是个人的，而是集体的。在我们的文化中，「ubuntu」（我在故我们在）告诉我们：你的身份来自你的关系、你的社区、你的责任。因此，寻找归属不是内省的旅程，而是建立联系的行动——与家人联系、与社区联系、与传统联系、与未来联系。陈君的作品若能从「我」走向「我们」，从个人焦虑走向集体行动，将更有社会意义。",
    "textEn": "Chen Jun's 'Origin Wandering' reminds me of our 'diaspora' experience. In African history, diaspora was not personal choice but cruel consequence of colonialism and slave trade. Millions of Africans were forcibly taken from ancestral lands, scattered across Americas, Caribbean, Europe. Their belonging question is not philosophical but existential—who am I? Where do I belong? Is my culture still there? However, diaspora also created new possibilities—African Americans, African Caribbeans, African Europeans developed new cultural forms (jazz, reggae, hip-hop); these cultures both retained African roots and incorporated new elements. This is what we call 'creolization'—not simple assimilation, nor clinging to tradition, but creative fusion. If Chen Jun could display this 'creative belonging' in the work—belonging is not returning to the past but creating new culture, new community, new identity in the present—it would be more powerful. I also want to emphasize: belonging is not individual but collective. In our culture, 'ubuntu' (I am because we are) tells us: your identity comes from your relationships, your community, your responsibilities. Therefore, seeking belonging is not an introspective journey but an action of building connections—connecting with family, with community, with tradition, with future. If Chen Jun's work could move from 'I' toward 'we,' from personal anxiety toward collective action, it would have more social significance.",

    "textZh": "陈君《源游》的混合媒介手法，从形式主义角度看，是对「单一媒介」的「陌生化」。传统艺术通常限定于单一媒介（绘画、雕塑、摄影等），观者对每种媒介的感知已「自动化」。混合媒介打破这种自动化，迫使观者重新思考：什么是绘画？什么是雕塑？媒介的边界在哪里？这种「媒介的陌生化」本身就具有「文学性」（literariness）。然而，俄国形式主义提醒我们：形式创新必须有「动机」（motivation）——不是为了创新而创新，而是形式服务于内容。陈君的混合媒介，其「动机」是什么？如果是为了表现「混合身份」「多元文化」，那么媒介的选择应该是有意义的——例如，传统媒介（中国画）与现代媒介（摄影、录像）的混合，可以象征传统与现代的张力；东方媒介与西方媒介的混合，可以象征文化交融。每一种媒介都应该承载特定的文化意义，而非随意拼贴。巴赫金的「杂语」（heteroglossia）理论在此也很有启发——在同一文本中，多种「语言」（不同阶层、不同地域、不同时代的语言）共存并对话。陈君的作品若能做到「媒介的杂语」——让不同媒介「说话」、「对话」、甚至「争论」——将创造丰富的意义层次。",
    "textEn": "Chen Jun's 'Origin Wandering's' mixed media technique, from a formalist perspective, is 'defamiliarization' of 'single medium.' Traditional art usually confines to single medium (painting, sculpture, photography, etc.); viewers' perception of each medium has been 'automatized.' Mixed media breaks this automatization, forcing viewers to reconsider: what is painting? What is sculpture? Where are medium's boundaries? This 'medium's defamiliarization' itself possesses 'literariness.' However, Russian Formalism reminds us: formal innovation must have 'motivation'—not innovation for innovation's sake but form serving content. What is the 'motivation' of Chen Jun's mixed media? If it's to express 'mixed identity,' 'multiple cultures,' then medium's selection should be meaningful—for instance, mixing traditional medium (Chinese painting) with modern medium (photography, video) can symbolize tradition-modernity tension; mixing Eastern medium with Western medium can symbolize cultural fusion. Each medium should carry specific cultural meaning, not random collage. Bakhtin's 'heteroglossia' theory is also very enlightening here—in the same text, multiple 'languages' (different classes', different regions', different eras' languages) coexist and dialogue. If Chen Jun's work could achieve 'medium's heteroglossia'—letting different media 'speak,' 'dialogue,' even 'argue'—it would create rich layers of meaning.",

    "textZh": "陈君《源游》在AI时代引发关于「算法化身份」的思考。当代人的身份越来越被数字系统定义：社交媒体的用户画像、电商平台的消费偏好、求职网站的职业标签、约会软件的匹配算法。这些系统不仅记录你的身份，更塑造你的身份——它们推送的内容影响你的认知，它们推荐的连接影响你的社交圈，它们预测的行为影响你的选择。在这种情况下，「归属」变成了「归属于哪个算法类别」——你是哪个用户群体？哪个目标市场？哪个风险等级？这种「算法归属」与传统的文化归属根本不同——后者是由你的生活经验、文化实践、社区关系决定的，前者是由你的数据痕迹、行为模式、算法模型决定的。更危险的是，算法归属常常是不透明的、不可控的——你不知道算法如何定义你，你也无法改变这种定义。陈君的作品若能批判性地审视这种「算法化的身份危机」——当机器定义我们是谁时，我们如何抵抗？如何保持自我定义的权利？——将非常及时。我建议可以引入「对抗性」的视角——例如展示某些「对抗算法分类」的实践（故意制造混乱的数字痕迹、拒绝单一身份标签、跨越算法类别的行动）。真正的归属不应该由算法决定，而应该由我们自己决定。",
    "textEn": "Chen Jun's 'Origin Wandering' provokes reflection on 'algorithmicized identity' in the AI era. Contemporary people's identity is increasingly defined by digital systems: social media user profiles, e-commerce platform consumption preferences, job website professional labels, dating app matching algorithms. These systems not only record your identity but shape your identity—the content they push influences your cognition, the connections they recommend influence your social circle, the behaviors they predict influence your choices. In this situation, 'belonging' becomes 'belonging to which algorithm category'—which user group are you? Which target market? Which risk level? This 'algorithmic belonging' is fundamentally different from traditional cultural belonging—the latter is determined by your life experiences, cultural practices, community relations; the former is determined by your data traces, behavior patterns, algorithm models. More dangerously, algorithmic belonging is often opaque, uncontrollable—you don't know how algorithms define you, you also cannot change this definition. If Chen Jun's work could critically examine this 'algorithmicized identity crisis'—when machines define who we are, how do we resist? How do we maintain the right of self-definition?—it would be very timely. I suggest introducing an 'adversarial' perspective—for instance displaying some practices of 'resisting algorithm classification' (deliberately creating chaotic digital traces, refusing single identity labels, actions crossing algorithm categories). True belonging should not be determined by algorithms but by ourselves.",
