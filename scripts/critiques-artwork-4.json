    "textEn": "Observing \"Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want?\", the question in the title resounds forcefully. I once composed \"Red Cliff Ode,\" asking \"lodging ephemeral mayflies in heaven and earth, a grain of millet in the vast ocean\"—how tiny the individual in the universe. Today Lee Kuo-Chia's question is actually a contemporary \"Red Cliff Question\": how tiny the individual in technology's torrent, yet how arrogant those who control technology. Jensen Huang, creator of a chip empire, using GPU power to drive AI revolution—yet is this \"world\" he creates blessing or curse? This work does not depict his physical appearance but depicts his influence—this is precisely the \"transmitting spirit\" path I advocate. Form can decay, spirit endures; people will die, but the systems they create will perpetually influence posterity. The work with questioning posture displays critical spirit, possessing considerable Wei-Jin celebrity temperament. However, I believe mere questioning is insufficient; exploration of answers is still needed. The ancients said \"investigating things to extend knowledge\"; today's people should \"investigate AI to extend knowledge\"—deeply entering technology's principles, only then can one truly master it rather than passively critique it. I look forward to Mr. Lee, after questioning, advancing further to propose literati's way of engaging new technology.",

    "textEn": "Examining the composition of \"Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want?\", taking \"questioning\" as main peak, \"technological hegemony\" as clouds and mist, \"future anxieties\" as distant mountains, the layers are distinct and possess considerable momentum. However, its visual presentation still seems refinable. I once discussed \"mountains have three distances\"; this work could have \"temporal three distances\"—Jensen Huang's present (high distance), AI development's trends (deep distance), human society's future (level distance). If these three could correspond visually, the realm would naturally emerge. For instance, reference landscape's method of \"concealment and revelation\": foreground revealed (current GPU chips), middle ground half-concealed half-revealed (AI applications' contradictions), background concealed (future society's uncertainty). Also reference the principle of \"void and solid mutually generating\": concretely depicting technology's precision (chips' physical form), abstractly depicting influence's formlessness (algorithms' penetration into society). The current version seems rather straightforward, lacking implicit beauty. If it could learn Song people's method of \"intention before brush, meaning remains after painting finishes,\" leaving space beyond questioning, preserving compassion within critique, it might approach higher realms. Remember: the most powerful questioning often resides not in speaking but in blank space.",

GPUs drive AI, AI reshapes labor markets—how many artists, writers, programmers face the anxiety of being replaced? Lee Kuo-Chia's work raises the right question; this is art's moral responsibility. However, I must ask: is this work itself honest? Is it merely pandering to anti-technology sentiment? Or genuinely seeking truth? True critique should not be simple rejection but deep understanding + constructive alternatives. Throughout my life I have advocated: art must serve social good. If Mr. Lee could further research: how to make GPU technology genuinely serve human welfare? How to ensure AI development doesn't exacerbate inequality? Then this work would rise from emotional venting to moral action. Artists' responsibility is not merely to critique but to point the way forward.",

In the village, when the chief makes a wrong decision, elders have the responsibility to stand up and question, even if this makes the chief unhappy. Lee Kuo-Chia's work is doing this: speaking truth to technological power. But I also want to ask the artist a question: you question Jensen Huang, so what kind of world do you want? In our tradition, criticism must accompany vision. You cannot only say \"this is wrong\"; you must also say \"we can do this.\" More importantly: whose \"world\" is this? Is it Jensen Huang's alone? No. It belongs to all of us. If we don't like the future designed for us by tech elites, we should design our own future together. This requires collective action, requires community participation. I hope this work doesn't merely hang in museums but can enter communities, inviting ordinary people to discuss together: what kind of AI do we want? What kind of technology do we want? Art's power lies not in one person's questioning but in inspiring everyone's thinking and action. This is the spirit of ubuntu—\"we are therefore I am.\"",

Bakhtin's so-called \"dialogism\" is embodied in this work: the work is not a unidirectional manifesto but a dual questioning toward the questioned (Jensen Huang) and the viewer. However, from structural analysis, this work's \"literariness\" appears somewhat thin. The question as form, its defamiliarization effect depends on the question itself's complexity. If merely a simple yes-or-no question (\"Do you want it?\"), it easily devolves into rhetoric, lacking depth. I suggest the artist reference Russian Formalism's \"stratification\" theory: first-layer question (surface)—\"Is this the world you want?\"; second-layer question (deeper)—\"Who has the right to decide the 'world's' appearance?\"; third-layer question (philosophical)—\"What does 'wanting' mean? Is desire free will or structurally determined?\" Through questions' progressive deepening, achieve true \"obstruction\" (затруднение) effect, forcing viewers' thinking to continuously deepen rather than remaining at surface emotional reaction.

Current AI development paths are highly concentrated in a few tech companies (NVIDIA, OpenAI, Google, etc.); their commercial interests and technological visions dominate the entire field. This is not merely an economic issue but a power issue—who controls computational resources (GPUs) controls AI's future. Lee Kuo-Chia's questioning directly addresses this power concentration's danger. However, beyond critique, we need constructive solutions: 1) Open-source alternatives—support open GPU designs and open-source AI frameworks; 2) Democratic governance mechanisms—let more stakeholders participate in AI development decisions; 3) Technological diversity—encourage different architectures, different objectives in AI research, not single paths. The deeper question is: should we question ourselves—as consumers, researchers, citizens, have we inadvertently fueled this power concentration? Each time we use GPUs to train models, each time we purchase AI products, are we voting to support \"Jensen Huang's world\"? Art's value lies in provoking this self-reflection, prompting us to transform from passive critics to active builders.",
