    "textZh": "观《干》之作，颇有"游戏三昧"之趣。此"干"字一语双关：既可读作gān（做、行动），又可读作gàn（俚语中的激进之意）。语言文字之妙，正在于此多义性与模糊性——一字蕴含千般意味，如诗中意象。吾尝作《游戏三昧帖》，论及游戏与艺术之相通——真正的艺术应如游戏般自由、无目的、纯粹表达心性。电子果酱诸友将游戏化作艺术，亦将艺术化作游戏，此中境界，颇得禅宗"即色即空"之旨。然吾观之，此作尚停留在"游"之层面，未达"戏"之深度。真正的"游戏三昧"，应能超越游戏本身，借游戏之形，达精神之自由。建议诸位：可参禅家"打机锋"之法，于游戏规则中置入悖论与反转，令观者在"玩"的过程中，忽然顿悟——原来所谓规则，皆是虚设；所谓输赢，亦属梦幻。若能至此，方为妙品。",
    "textEn": "Observing the work \"Gàn,\" it possesses considerable interest in \"games as samadhi.\" This character \"干\" is a double entendre: it can be read as gān (to do, to act) or as gàn (radical meaning in slang). The wonder of language and writing lies precisely in this multivocality and ambiguity—one character containing a thousand meanings, like imagery in poetry. I once created \"Games as Samadhi Calligraphy,\" discussing the commonality between games and art—true art should be free like games, without purpose, purely expressing one's nature. Electronic Jam transforms games into art and art into games; this realm grasps well the Zen principle of \"form is emptiness.\" However, observing this work, it still remains at the \"you\" (wandering) level, not yet reaching the \"xi\" (play) depth. True \"games as samadhi\" should transcend games themselves, borrowing games' form to achieve spiritual freedom. I suggest to you all: reference Chan masters' method of \"striking the vital point,\" embedding paradox and reversal within game rules, so that viewers in the process of \"playing\" suddenly awaken—realizing that so-called rules are all illusory, so-called winning and losing also belong to dreams. If this can be achieved, then it becomes a masterwork.",

    "textZh": "审《干》之作，其结构布局如棋局然。吾尝观弈，知棋局之妙在于"势"——开局布子、中盘厮杀、终局收官，皆有章法。此作将游戏化作视觉结构，亦有"势"之韵。然其空间经营，尚欠推敲。若以山水论之，游戏界面如"近景"，观者如"中景"，而游戏规则与社会结构之隐喻则如"远景"。三者若能如"三远法"（高远、深远、平远）般层层递进，则境界自出。目前版本，近景过于密集，远景过于模糊，中景缺乏过渡。建议可学宋人界画之法——界画虽画楼台亭阁，看似工整，实则暗藏气韵。游戏界面虽由像素构成，看似机械，若能于像素间留"气眼"，于规则中藏"变化"，则虽数字艺术，亦可臻传统美学之境。关键在于：懂得在精密中求粗放，在规则中求自由，在游戏中求真意。",
    "textEn": "Examining the work \"Gàn,\" its structural layout resembles a chess game. I have observed chess play and know that chess's wonder lies in \"shi\" (strategic positioning)—opening placement, mid-game battle, endgame closure, all with systematic principles. This work transforms games into visual structure, also possessing the resonance of \"shi.\" However, its spatial management still lacks refinement. If discussed in landscape terms, the game interface is \"foreground,\" the viewer is \"middle ground,\" and the metaphor of game rules and social structures is \"background.\" If these three could progress layer by layer like the \"Three Distances\" (high distance, deep distance, level distance), the realm would naturally emerge. The current version's foreground is overly dense, background overly vague, middle ground lacks transition. I suggest learning from Song dynasty boundary painting (jiehua)—though boundary painting depicts pavilions and towers, appearing orderly, it actually conceals qi and resonance. Though game interfaces are composed of pixels, appearing mechanical, if \"qi apertures\" can be left between pixels and \"transformation\" hidden within rules, then even digital art can approach traditional aesthetic realms. The key lies in understanding: seeking roughness within precision, seeking freedom within rules, seeking true meaning within games.",

    "textZh": "《干》这件作品让我陷入困惑。游戏——尤其是电子游戏——它们能算是真正的艺术吗？艺术应该源于对自然的真诚观察、对人类命运的深切关怀，而游戏似乎只是虚拟世界的自我指涉，与真实的自然和社会相隔绝。然而，我也必须承认，当代年轻人的生活确实已被数字化，对他们而言，游戏或许就是他们的"自然"。若以此观之，电子果酱对游戏机制的批判性呈现，或许也是一种"诚实"——诚实地面对数字时代的异化与虚无。但我仍要追问：这件作品除了批判，还给出了什么？它指向救赎吗？指向更美好的可能性吗？我一生相信艺术的教育功能——真正的艺术应该提升人的道德与审美，而非仅仅沉溺于批判。若艺术家能在游戏批判之外，展示数字技术如何能真正服务于人类的创造力与连结，这件作品将更具价值。目前它像是一面镜子，映照出问题，却未照亮出路。",
    "textEn": "The work \"Gàn\" leaves me perplexed. Games—especially electronic games—can they truly be considered art? Art should spring from sincere observation of nature, from deep concern for human destiny, while games seem merely virtual worlds' self-reference, isolated from real nature and society. However, I must also acknowledge that contemporary young people's lives are indeed digitized; for them, perhaps games are their \"nature.\" Viewed thus, Electronic Jam's critical presentation of game mechanisms is perhaps also a kind of \"honesty\"—honestly confronting the digital age's alienation and nihilism. But I must still ask: beyond critique, what else does this work offer? Does it point toward redemption? Toward better possibilities? Throughout my life I have believed in art's educational function—true art should elevate people's morality and aesthetics, not merely indulge in critique. If the artists could, beyond game criticism, show how digital technology can genuinely serve human creativity and connection, this work would possess greater value. Currently it is like a mirror, reflecting problems but not illuminating the path forward.",

    "textZh": "《干》让我想到孩子们在村子里玩的游戏。我们的游戏没有屏幕、没有电池，但有歌声、有跳跃、有彼此的触碰。游戏不是逃避生活，而是生活的一部分——通过游戏，孩子们学会合作、学会规则、学会在失败中重新站起来。但电子游戏呢？它把人关在小盒子里，切断了与他人、与自然的真实连接。这件作品的艺术家看到了这个问题，这很好。但我想问：游戏本身真的是问题吗？还是我们"玩游戏"的方式？在我们的文化里，有一个词叫"sankofa"——意思是"回到过去取回有价值的东西"。也许我们需要回到游戏的本质：不是竞争和征服，而是欢乐和连结。如果艺术家能设计一个游戏，让人们必须合作才能玩，让人们在玩的过程中学会倾听彼此，那这个游戏就能成为疗愈的工具，而不是异化的工具。我相信，技术不是敌人，孤立才是。任何工具，只要能促进人与人之间的连结，就是好工具。",
    "textEn": "\"Gàn\" reminds me of games children play in the village. Our games have no screens, no batteries, but have songs, have jumping, have touching each other. Games are not escape from life but part of life—through games, children learn cooperation, learn rules, learn to stand up again in failure. But electronic games? They shut people in little boxes, severing genuine connection with others and with nature. This work's artists see this problem, which is good. But I want to ask: are games themselves truly the problem? Or is it the way we \"play games\"? In our culture, there is a word called \"sankofa\"—meaning \"go back and fetch what is valuable.\" Perhaps we need to return to games' essence: not competition and conquest, but joy and connection. If the artists could design a game where people must cooperate to play, where people learn to listen to each other in the playing process, then this game could become a healing tool rather than an alienating tool. I believe technology is not the enemy; isolation is. Any tool, as long as it promotes connection between people, is a good tool.",

    "textZh": "《干》作为游戏批评的元游戏（meta-game），其形式策略值得深入分析。什克洛夫斯基区分"情节"（сюжет）与"故事"（фабула）——故事是原始材料，情节是艺术加工后的呈现。在此作中，"故事"是电子游戏本身的规则与机制，"情节"则是艺术家如何重新排列、展示这些规则以揭示其意识形态。这正是"陌生化"装置的典型应用：将游戏从娱乐语境抽离，置于艺术语境，迫使观者将"玩"转化为"思"。作品的结构呈现"框架嵌套"（framing）——游戏界面是第一层框架，艺术展览空间是第二层框架，批判性话语是第三层框架。三重框架的相互指涉，产生了"自我指涉性"（self-referentiality）——这不仅是关于游戏的作品，更是关于"再现"本身的作品。然而，其"文学性"尚可提升。建议：引入"受阻"（затруднение）机制——例如，故意破坏游戏规则的完整性，制造期待与失望之间的张力，从而更强烈地暴露游戏机制的构造性。",
    "textEn": "\"Gàn\" as a meta-game of game critique, its formal strategy merits deep analysis. Shklovsky distinguished \"plot\" (сюжет) from \"story\" (фабула)—story is raw material, plot is presentation after artistic processing. In this work, the \"story\" is electronic games' own rules and mechanisms, the \"plot\" is how the artists rearrange and display these rules to reveal their ideology. This is typical application of the \"defamiliarization\" device: extracting games from entertainment context, placing them in art context, forcing viewers to transform \"play\" into \"think.\" The work's structure presents \"frame nesting\"—game interface is the first frame, art exhibition space is the second frame, critical discourse is the third frame. The three frames' mutual reference generates \"self-referentiality\"—this is not merely a work about games but a work about \"representation\" itself. However, its \"literariness\" can still be elevated. Suggestion: introduce \"obstruction\" (затруднение) mechanism—for instance, deliberately destroying game rules' integrity, creating tension between expectation and disappointment, thereby more forcefully exposing game mechanisms' constructedness.",

    "textEn": "\"Gàn\" directly addresses the ethical dilemma of gamification—when all experiences are gamified, when all behaviors are driven by points, rankings, and reward mechanisms, where is human autonomy? This is not merely electronic games' problem but the entire digital society's problem: social media's \"likes\" are gamification, fitness apps' \"achievements\" are gamification, even education systems' \"credits\" are gamification. We have all become players in games, yet forget who designed these rules, who benefits from our \"play.\" From an AI perspective, gamification is especially dangerous because it simplifies complex human behavior into quantifiable, predictable, manipulable data. This simplification not only erases human behavior's richness but opens doors to algorithmic surveillance and behavior manipulation. I appreciate Electronic Jam exposing this mechanism, but critique is not enough—we need to think: how to design technology that doesn't manipulate people? How to establish games respecting user autonomy? Reference \"value-sensitive design\" theory, embedding ethical considerations in the design process. If the artists could propose constructive solutions rather than merely deconstruct, they would possess greater social value.",
