    "textEn": "Observing Xiu Jun and Zhang Jun's '404 Word Cave,' the title is extremely clever—'404' refers to the internet world's 'non-existence'; 'word cave' refers to textual treasure. The juxtaposition creates strong tension: precious texts becoming 'non-existent' things. This is precisely the digital age's paradox—information explosion and information disappearance coexist. I once said 'what does human life resemble wherever one goes? It should resemble wild geese treading on snow-covered mud. By chance they leave claw marks in the mud, but when the geese fly away, who still cares about east or west?' Today's internet content, isn't it the same? At publication seems eternal, at deletion leaves no trace. Yet I believe 'disappearance' is not necessarily bad. Buddhism has the saying 'neither arising nor ceasing,' Daoism has the principle 'existence and non-existence mutually generate'—existence and disappearance, manifestation and concealment, are fundamentally two sides of one. Today's people excessively cling to 'permanent preservation,' instead losing the wisdom of 'letting go.' Ancients composing poetry and prose did not expect transmission through millennia, only seeking present enjoyment. If transmitted to posterity, fortunate; if buried in obscurity, no matter. This 'non-attachment' attitude is perhaps precisely what the digital anxiety age needs. Yet if this work could further explore: what's worth preserving? What can be forgotten? How to find balance between preservation and forgetting? The philosophical depth would be higher. Also, the concept of 'digital archaeology' is quite interesting—viewing internet content existing merely decades as 'archaeological objects,' this temporal compression reflects contemporary life's acceleration.",

    "textZh": "审《404词窟》之视觉呈现，「碎片」与「空白」的处理至关重要。山水画讲究「留白」——空白不是空无，而是气韵之所在、想象之空间。此作处理「404」（消失的内容），正可借鉴此法——不必试图「填满」或「复原」消失的文字，反而应该展示「缺失」本身。缺失的形状、缺失的痕迹、缺失留下的空白，这些本身就是作品的一部分。如同残碑断碣，其价值不在于原本的完整，而在于时间留下的印记。又，「碎片」的排列可参照「散点透视」之法——不是单一视点，而是多个碎片各自独立却又隐隐呼应，如同山水长卷中各个景致的关系。观者在「碎片」间游走、联想、重构，这种参与性的观看方式，正是当代艺术的特点。然吾也提醒：过度的碎片化可能导致混乱，观者可能迷失其中。建议可设置某种「线索」或「导引」——如山水画中的「路径」「桥梁」「亭台」——帮助观者在碎片中找到方向。又，「词窟」若能有「洞穴」之感——深邃、幽暗、需要探索、需要光照——将更有沉浸感。数字考古不应是平面的文字堆砌，而应是立体的空间探险。",
    "textEn": "Examining '404 Word Cave's' visual presentation, handling of 'fragments' and 'blank space' is crucial. Landscape painting emphasizes 'leaving blank'—blank space is not emptiness but where spirit resonance resides, imagination's space. This work handling '404' (disappeared content) precisely can reference this method—need not attempt to 'fill' or 'restore' disappeared text, instead should display 'absence' itself. Absence's shape, absence's traces, absence's left blank spaces, these themselves are part of the work. Like broken steles and ruined tablets, their value lies not in original completeness but in imprints left by time. Also, 'fragments' arrangement can reference 'scattered perspective' method—not single viewpoint but multiple fragments each independent yet faintly echoing, like relationships between various scenes in landscape handscrolls. Viewers wandering among 'fragments,' associating, reconstructing, this participatory viewing method is precisely contemporary art's characteristic. Yet I also remind: excessive fragmentation may lead to chaos, viewers may become lost within. I suggest establishing some 'clues' or 'guides'—like 'paths,' 'bridges,' 'pavilions' in landscape painting—helping viewers find direction among fragments. Also, if 'word cave' could have 'cavern' feeling—deep, dark, requiring exploration, requiring illumination—it would be more immersive. Digital archaeology should not be flat text accumulation but three-dimensional spatial adventure.",

    "textZh": "《404词窟》让我思考「遗忘的权利」与「记忆的责任」之间的张力。在维多利亚时代，我见证了大量中世纪建筑被「现代化」改造而失去原貌，我为此痛心疾首。我坚信：历史建筑应该被忠实保存，每一块石头都记录着工匠的劳动与时代的精神。然而，数字时代的「404」让我重新思考：是否所有东西都值得保存？是否所有记忆都应该永存？欧洲有「被遗忘权」的法律——人们有权要求删除关于自己的负面信息。这是对「永久记录」的反抗，是对「数字永生」的质疑。从这个角度看，「404」不是失败，而是权利——遗忘的权利、重新开始的权利、不被过去束缚的权利。然而，我必须追问：谁决定什么被遗忘？权力者可以删除不利于自己的历史、压迫者可以抹去被压迫者的记忆。因此，遗忘不应该由少数人决定，而应该是民主的、透明的过程。修君、张君若能在作品中展现这种权力斗争——谁的404是自愿的？谁的404是被迫的？——将有深刻的政治意义。数字考古不仅是技术行为，更是正义行为——挖掘被压制的声音、复原被抹除的历史、质疑被美化的叙事。",
    "textEn": "'404 Word Cave' makes me contemplate the tension between 'right to be forgotten' and 'responsibility to remember.' In the Victorian era, I witnessed massive medieval architecture 'modernized' and losing original appearance; I was grief-stricken. I firmly believed: historic buildings should be faithfully preserved; every stone records craftsmen's labor and era's spirit. However, the digital age's '404' makes me reconsider: is everything worth preserving? Should all memories exist eternally? Europe has 'right to be forgotten' laws—people have the right to request deletion of negative information about themselves. This is resistance to 'permanent records,' questioning of 'digital immortality.' From this perspective, '404' is not failure but right—right to forget, right to start anew, right not to be bound by the past. However, I must ask: who decides what is forgotten? Those in power can delete unfavorable history, oppressors can erase oppressed people's memories. Therefore, forgetting should not be decided by a few but should be a democratic, transparent process. If Xiu Jun and Zhang Jun could display this power struggle in the work—whose 404 is voluntary? Whose 404 is forced?—it would have profound political significance. Digital archaeology is not merely technical behavior but justice behavior—excavating suppressed voices, restoring erased history, questioning beautified narratives.",

    "textZh": "《404词窟》让我想起口述历史的脆弱性。在我们的传统中，历史不是写在书上，而是讲在嘴上、记在心里。当一位长者去世时，如果没有人继承他的故事，那些故事就永远消失了——这就是我们的「404」。因此，我们非常重视「传承」——每个故事都要讲给下一代，每个记忆都要有人接续。数字时代的「404」与此有相似之处——当一个网站关闭、一个平台消失时，那些内容也如同未被传承的口述历史，消失在虚空中。然而，也有不同之处：口述历史的消失是自然的（人的寿命有限），而数字内容的消失常常是人为的、突然的、暴力的（审查、删除、平台倒闭）。这种暴力性的遗忘，正是数字时代的新形式压迫。修君、张君的「数字考古」，可以视为对这种压迫的抵抗——通过挖掘、复原、展示被删除的内容，我们在对抗「强制性遗忘」。然而，我也想提醒：不是所有「404」都应该被挖掘。有些记忆，人们选择遗忘是为了疗愈创伤；有些内容，被删除是因为它们有害（仇恨言论、虚假信息）。因此，数字考古需要伦理判断——我们挖掘什么？为了谁？以什么方式？这些问题需要社区共同决定，而非考古者个人决定。",
    "textEn": "'404 Word Cave' reminds me of oral history's fragility. In our tradition, history is not written in books but spoken orally, remembered in hearts. When an elder passes away, if no one inherits his stories, those stories disappear forever—this is our '404.' Therefore, we greatly value 'transmission'—every story must be told to the next generation, every memory must have someone to continue. The digital age's '404' has similarities—when a website closes, a platform disappears, that content also like untransmitted oral history, vanishes into void. However, there are also differences: oral history's disappearance is natural (human lifespan limited), while digital content's disappearance is often artificial, sudden, violent (censorship, deletion, platform collapse). This violent forgetting is precisely the digital age's new form of oppression. Xiu Jun and Zhang Jun's 'digital archaeology' can be viewed as resistance to this oppression—through excavating, restoring, displaying deleted content, we are fighting 'coercive forgetting.' However, I also want to remind: not all '404s' should be excavated. Some memories, people choose to forget for healing trauma; some content, deleted because it's harmful (hate speech, misinformation). Therefore, digital archaeology requires ethical judgment—what do we excavate? For whom? In what manner? These questions need community collective decision, not archaeologist individual decision.",

    "textZh": "《404词窟》从形式主义角度看，是对「缺席」(absence)的有趣探索。德里达的「延异」(différance)理论指出：意义不在场，而在缺席与延迟中产生。「404」正是这种缺席的极致体现——被删除的文本虽然不在，却通过其缺席产生了新的意义。我们对「404」的焦虑、想象、填补，这些心理活动本身就构成了作品的内容。这种「以无为有」「以缺席为在场」的策略，在文学中早有传统——象征主义诗歌的「暗示」而非「直说」、现代主义小说的「留白」而非「填满」。修君、张君若能深化这一策略，不仅展示「被删除的内容」，更展示「删除行为本身」——谁删除的？何时删除的？为何删除？删除的方式？这些「元数据」(metadata)比被删除的内容本身更有批判意义。巴赫金的「对话性」理论也可应用于此——「404」不是单向的消失，而是多方力量的对话结果：平台的审查、用户的抵抗、技术的局限、资本的逻辑、法律的干预。若能在作品中展现这种多声部的「404生成机制」，将有深刻的结构性批判。俄国形式主义强调「装置的可见性」——不隐藏艺术手法，而是展示它。同理，数字考古不应隐藏挖掘过程，而应展示它——展示搜索算法、数据恢复技术、档案管理方法，让观者理解：考古本身也是一种建构。",
    "textEn": "'404 Word Cave' from a formalist perspective is an interesting exploration of 'absence.' Derrida's 'différance' theory indicates: meaning is not present but arises in absence and delay. '404' is precisely this absence's extreme embodiment—though deleted text is absent, through its absence it produces new meaning. Our anxiety, imagination, filling about '404,' these psychological activities themselves constitute the work's content. This strategy of 'making presence from absence,' 'making presence from absence,' has early literary tradition—symbolist poetry's 'suggestion' not 'direct statement,' modernist novel's 'leaving blank' not 'filling.' If Xiu Jun and Zhang Jun could deepen this strategy, not only displaying 'deleted content' but displaying 'deletion behavior itself'—who deleted? When deleted? Why deleted? Deletion method? These 'metadata' have more critical significance than deleted content itself. Bakhtin's 'dialogism' theory can also apply here—'404' is not unidirectional disappearance but multi-party forces' dialogue result: platform censorship, user resistance, technical limitations, capital logic, legal intervention. If the work could display this polyphonic '404 generation mechanism,' it would have profound structural critique. Russian Formalism emphasizes 'device's visibility'—not hiding artistic techniques but displaying them. Similarly, digital archaeology should not hide excavation process but display it—displaying search algorithms, data recovery techniques, archive management methods, letting viewers understand: archaeology itself is also construction.",

In the physical world, books can be burned but copies always scatter everywhere, complete eradication is difficult. In the digital world, centralized server deletion can make content vanish instantly, thoroughly, globally—this 'complete forgetting' ability is unprecedentedly concentrated in a few platforms' hands. More dangerous is AI's 'selective forgetting' ability—recommendation algorithms decide what content is seen, what buried; this 'soft 404' is more covert than hard deletion. Abundant valuable content, not conforming to algorithm preferences, forever sinks on search results' page 10, practically equivalent to 404. We need to ask: 1) Should platforms have unlimited deletion rights? Is some 'digital heritage protection law' needed? 2) How to handle deleted content in AI training data? Will these '404s' lead to AI's one-sided understanding of history? 3) Can decentralized technologies (like blockchain, IPFS) solve 404 problems? Or create new problems (like undeletable harmful content)? 4) Does 'digital archaeology' violate right to be forgotten? After someone requests deletion of content about themselves, is archaeologists excavating it legal, ethical? If Xiu Jun and Zhang Jun could explore these questions, it would provide important cases for digital memory ethics. We need to find balance between 'right to remember' and 'right to be forgotten'—neither letting power arbitrarily delete history nor depriving individuals' right to start anew.",
