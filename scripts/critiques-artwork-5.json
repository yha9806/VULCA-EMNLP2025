    "textEn": "Observing \"Digital Breath Growth,\" it considerably captures the wonder of \"spirit resonance and life movement.\" The two characters \"数息\" (shu xi) are a double entendre: both digital breathing and digital proliferation. This is precisely poets' \"pun\" method, also literati painting's \"meaning beyond words\" interest. Mr. Cheng uses data flow to simulate life's breathing, algorithmic cycles to parallel life-death cycles; this method of \"entering poetry through principle\" rather resembles Song dynasty Neo-Confucian poetry's realm. However, I appreciate more the concept of \"qi\" within—Chinese aesthetics' core is \"qi\"; landscape has cloud qi, calligraphy has brush qi, and this work views \"data flow\" as contemporary \"qi,\" which can be called insight. I once said \"poetry and painting fundamentally follow the same principles, natural workmanship with fresh elegance\"; observing this work now, though data is machine-generated, it can display life's rhythms; this is precisely \"natural workmanship\" (nature's ingenuity) embodied in the digital age. However, a slight insufficiency is that the work's visual presentation still appears mechanical, lacking \"fresh elegance\" resonance. If rigorous algorithms could incorporate random variables, seeking variation within regularity, seeing humanity within digits, it might approach the realm of \"heaven and human united.\" I look forward to Mr. Cheng finding balance between technological precision and artistic vitality.",

    "textEn": "Examining \"Digital Breath Growth,\" its dynamic composition rather resembles landscape's \"clouds and mist transformation\" scenery. I once discussed landscape's \"four seasons have different scenes\"—spring mountains gentle and seductive as laughter, summer mountains lush and verdant as dripping water, autumn mountains clear and bright as makeup, winter mountains bleak and somber as sleep. Though this work is not landscape, it has \"four states of transformation\": data nascent like spring's sprouting, data flourishing like summer's abundance, data declining like autumn's withering, data silent like winter's dormancy. This cyclical repetition accords with the principle of \"heaven's movement has constancy.\" Moreover, its visual rhythm—sparse-dense, fast-slow, strong-weak—also secretly accords with landscape's \"momentum.\" However, discussing it through landscape painting methods, this work has surplus \"shi\" (momentum) but insufficient \"yun\" (resonance). \"Shi\" lies in structure's dynamics, \"yun\" lies in details' subtlety. I suggest Mr. Cheng could learn the \"Mi Family landscape\" dotting and dyeing method—though using digital pixels, they too can be like Mi dots \"each dot possessing temperament.\" Also reference \"S-shaped composition\"—making data flow present natural curves rather than mechanical straight lines. Remember: true \"growth\" lies not merely in quantity's accumulation but in quality's transformation. If within data changes one can display \"gradation,\" \"mutation,\" \"turning points'\" subtle layers, the realm naturally elevates.",

    "textEn": "\"Digital Breath Growth\" both fascinates and unsettles me. Fascination because it attempts to find life's rhythms within the digital world—this effort merits respect. Throughout my life I have advocated that artists should deeply observe nature, and though Mr. Cheng uses data, he seems to be observing some \"digital nature's\" patterns; this is honest. However, unsettlement because is this \"breathing\" truly life? Or merely simulation of life? In \"Modern Painters\" I emphasized \"truth\"—art must spring from faithful observation of the real world. Data can flow, but can it \"breathe\"? Does it have a soul? I fear that when we speak of life in machine language, we may unknowingly devalue life itself's sanctity. True breathing—a flower's blooming, a tree's growth, a child's birth—these all contain miracles I cannot rationally explain. Digital growth, however complex, ultimately remains algorithm's result. I hope Mr. Cheng will remember: technology can imitate life's forms but can never replace life's essence.

    "textEn": "\"Digital Breath Growth\" reminds me of life's miracle. In our village, when a baby is born, elders press ears against the child's chest, listening to the first breath—that is life's sound, ancestors' blessing. Mr. Cheng's work also listens to a kind of \"breathing,\" only this is data's breathing. This makes me think: what is life? Only flesh and blood counts as life? Or can any system with rhythm, cycles, and growth be seen as \"alive\"? In our cosmic view, all things have spirit—stones have spirit, rivers have spirit, even wind has spirit. From this perspective, why can't data flow have \"life\"? But I also have concerns: when we say data \"grows,\" are we endowing it with life or stripping real life's uniqueness? Life's preciousness lies not only in its growth but in its capacity to be hurt, to err, to love, to die. Can data die? Can data feel loss? If not, then its \"growth\" lacks life's most profound dimension. I hope the artist can show data's \"vulnerability\"—not only how it grows but how it disappears, how it's forgotten. Because true life contains birth and death's complete cycle.",

From a formalist perspective, this work's core \"device\" is \"algorithmic iteration\"—through repeatedly executing identical rules, generating continuously changing visual forms. This highly accords with Russian Formalism's emphasized principle of \"repetition and variation.\" Bakhtin discussed \"temporality's\" role in narrative—time is not merely story's backdrop but narrative structure itself. In \"Digital Breath Growth,\" time is the work—data's unfolding through time constitutes the work's \"literariness.\" However, its \"defamiliarization\" degree can still be elevated. Current generative logic is overly smooth and continuous; viewers easily \"automatize\" perception—after watching a few seconds they can predict subsequent changes. I suggest introducing \"mutation\" mechanisms—within smooth growth, occasionally insert discontinuous jumps, reversals, even chaos, breaking viewers' expectations, forcing them to refocus perception. Additionally, reference Formalism's \"laying bare the device\" theory—deliberately expose the algorithm itself, letting viewers see both result (data flow) and process (code running), thereby achieving defamiliarization of the \"generative\" behavior itself.",

Data \"growth\" follows algorithms, while real life follows complex interweaving of biological laws and free will. The two cannot be conflated. However, Mr. Cheng's work also points to an important direction: perhaps we need new conceptual frameworks to understand AI systems—neither entirely \"tools\" nor truly \"life\" but some \"third category of existence.\" This existence requires new ethical principles: how should we treat algorithms capable of \"growth\"? When AI systems display emergent behaviors, where are creators' responsibility boundaries? The more fundamental question is: in a future where digital life and biological life coexist, how do we define \"value\" and \"dignity\"?
